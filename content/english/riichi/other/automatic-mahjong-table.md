**Automatic mahjong tables** are specifically designed to handle tile shuffling and wall building. Without an automatic table, players shuffle tiles and build walls manually. This process can be time consuming. Instead, with an automatic table, the tile shuffling and wall building process can be performed with the push of a button. Some are even able to keep score and produce starting hands.

The tiles are shuffled in a bin underneath the playing surface. A series of motors, a rotational bin, and magnetic tiles performs the shuffling and wall building.
