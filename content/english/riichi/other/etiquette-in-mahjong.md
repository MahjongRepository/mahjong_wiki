The game also offers some guidelines on game **etiquette**. Not necessarily enforceable via the
games rules, they are still important to maintain a positive game environment. Depending on the
decorum, the level of etiquette may vary given different environments and settings. Professional
mahjong settings require very high level etiquette standards. In contrast, casual games among
friends may be played with lower levels of etiquette.

## Etiquette principles

Much of the etiquette stems on one simple principle: **Respect for the game and respect for the
players**. As long as players can adhere to this concept, then everyone at the mahjong table can
play with a positive game environment. Yet, levels of etiquette will vary by decorum. Professional
settings require a very high level of etiquette, by which a break in protocol may warrant some
penalties or some disciplinary action. On the other hand, casual settings provide a more relaxed
environment, especially in a game played among friends. Given the setting, players should be aware
of the level of etiquette, warranted by the playing environment.

## Specific guidelines

A number of guidelines point to specific aspects to the game.

### Handling of tiles

### Point exchanges

Point exchanges are best done efficiently and with proper display.

When paying points, players may have the tendency to retain their larger point sticks in order to
make their score appear larger. However, it makes no difference, as a player's score is the player's
current score. A specific example is a deal in for 3900. Instead of giving away three 1000 sticks
and 900 points, it is more efficient to give a 5000 point stick while receiving 1100 points in
return.

To pay with point sticks, players should place the proper amounts on the play area. This allows all
players on the table to see the point exchange, whether the amounts exchanged are the proper
amounts. Naturally, the points should be placed on the table directly, rather than being thrown or
directly into another player's pile.

If possible, players should try to retain at least one 1000 point stick in possession at all times.
If necessary, players may exchange larger sticks in order to attain change from the player in
possession of many. This exchange is best done just before the next tile shuffle. Though, if
necessary, the exchange can be done during a riichi call. Finally, it can be disruptive to gameplay
during any other time throughout a hand.
