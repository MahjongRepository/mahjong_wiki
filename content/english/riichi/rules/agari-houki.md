**Agari houki** {{< kana "アガリ放棄" >}}, or a **dead hand**, is a lesser penalty compared to
[chombo]({{< ref "/riichi/rules/chombo.md" >}}). A penalty for a dead hand denies the player to win
the corresponding turn, when the minor rule violation was committed. A player may still defend the
hand and utilize [betaori]({{< ref "/riichi/strategy/betaori.md" >}}).

When the player's hand is declared dead, additional tile calls are prohibited. This includes all
[tile calls]({{< ref "/riichi/rules/naki.md" >}}), win by ron or tsumo, or declare
[riichi]({{< ref "/riichi/rules/riichi.md" >}}). Afterwards, play continues; and the penalized
player must continue to draw and discard tiles as normal. Once again, all tile calls are barred. Any
additional tile calls with a dead hand results in a [chombo]({{< ref "/riichi/rules/chombo.md" >}}).
If the player called riichi before the hand was declared dead, the hand continues but 1000 points
for riichi may not be reclaimed. Finally, if the hand results in
[ryuukyoku]({{< ref "/riichi/rules/ryuukyoku.md" >}}), dead hand is never considered
[tenpai]({{< ref "/riichi/strategy/tenpai.md" >}}), because a win may not be called.

## Wrong amount of tiles

At any point of the game, if the player has less or more than 13 tiles before drawing the next tile,
the hand is considered dead.

## Drawing from the dead wall

Accidentally drawing from the dead wall will result in a dead hand.

## Improper tile calls

Players may end up calling on discarded tiles, without having the appropriate tiles to complete a
[tile group]({{< ref "/riichi/terminology/mentsu.md" >}}). For example, a player may call "pon" on a
tile, without having the prerequisite [paired tiles]({{< ref "/riichi/terminology/toitsu.md" >}}).
