**Chombo** {{< kana "冲合" >}} is a penalty for heavy rule violations. Some moves may be considered
minor and correctable, like accidentally drawing the wrong tile from the wall. Rule violations
subject to chombo are harsh enough to abort the hand and impose a point loss on the offender.

In all instances of chombo, the current hand is then aborted and repeated. Players who have declared
[riichi]({{< ref "/riichi/rules/riichi.md" >}}) during the aborted hand get their riichi bet back.
Most rules leave the [honba]({{< ref "/riichi/rules/honba.md" >}}) count unchanged for the repeat,
while some rules may handle this like any other [abortive
draw]({{< ref "/riichi/rules/tochuu-ryuukyoku.md" >}}).

## Application

A player penalized with chombo must pay a specified point penalty, depending on the setting. The
most common is a mangan-sized penalty. To each other player, the offender must pay what the offender
would have received on a mangan tsumo without [honba]({{< ref "/riichi/rules/honba.md" >}}). In
other words, the offender pays a "reverse mangan tsumo". An offending dealer must pay 4,000 to
everyone, and offending non-dealers must pay 2,000 to each non-dealer and 4,000 to the dealer. In
some instances, the points specified may directly affect the
[uma]({{< ref "/riichi/rules/oka-and-uma.md" >}}), or the +/- end scores. As a time saver, chombo
penalties may be applied post-game, especially when a time limit is imposed. Casual settings may
simply ignore and bypass chombo altogether.

Another application of chombo penalizes the player post-game. After the end score calculation with
[oka]({{< ref "/riichi/rules/oka-and-uma.md" >}}) and
[uma]({{< ref "/riichi/rules/oka-and-uma.md" >}}), a point penalty is applied. This format is
relevant in tournament formats, where accumulated points play a role to overall standings. The
deducted points is at the discretion of the tournament organizer.

## Infraction cases

A number of instances can place a player under chombo. All of these can be noted as "improper play"
and a disregard of the game rules. Often, the penalties are accidental, but intentional penalized
plays are also to be noted.

### Cheating

Cheating is very possible in the game. In fact, some players can execute various and elaborate
cheating tricks. Some tricks involve "wall rigging" by deliberately placing tiles along certain
positions on the wall. Other tricks involving tile switching from any part of the wall or even from
the discard pile. Many of tricks involve the _sleight of hand_. The most skilled cheaters have the
ability to perform these tricks with minimal detection, if any.

Tournament judges might decide on an even more severe punishment than chombo or disqualify the
cheater.

### Invalid win

Players cannot declare a win with an incomplete hand or on an incorrect waiting tile. The following
conditions are deemed as invalid win:

- **The hand must have at least one [yaku]({{< ref "/riichi/yaku/yaku.md" >}}) minimum to win**.
  Therefore, declaring a win on a hand without yaku is penalized.
- A player in [furiten]({{< ref "/riichi/strategy/furiten.md" >}}) cannot win by ron. Instead, by
  the rule of furiten, a player is limited to winning via tsumo. Declaring ron while furiten is
  penalized.
- Declaring a win with a noten hand is definitely subject to chombo.

### Invalid call

Making an invalid call may be subjected to chombo. Showing the incorrect tiles for a certain call
can be easily corrected if the player can still make a meld with that call, but if a call was made
and the resulting meld is illegal, then chombo applies.

**Example:** {{< t 3455m468p445s1z >}} {{< t 2-22z >}}

- Shimocha drops {{< t 4s >}} and player calls _pon_, then shows {{< t 45s >}}: Minor mistake. Can
  be corrected by revealing the {{< t 44s >}}
- Shimocha drops {{< t 5s >}} and player calls _pon_, then shows {{< t 45s >}}: Chombo is applied.

### Noten riichi

Riichi may only be declared with a [tenpai]({{< ref "/riichi/strategy/tenpai.md" >}}) hand.
Declaring riichi with a noten hand is not detected by the other players immediately. It goes
unpunished if another player wins the hand or on an [abortive
draw]({{< ref "/riichi/rules/tochuu-ryuukyoku.md" >}}). The noten riichi is punished with chombo if
the player declares a win, or when the hand must be revealed at
[ryuukyoku]({{< ref "/riichi/rules/ryuukyoku.md" >}}).

### Unrevealed riichi

If the hand ends in [ryuukyoku]({{< ref "/riichi/rules/ryuukyoku.md" >}}), riichi declarers must
show their hands as proof of being in tenpai. Depending on the specific rules, a player may refuse
to show the hand and instead take the penalty, even when tenpai.

### Invalid ankan

`main|Kan\#Kan during riichi`

During riichi, a player may call [kan]({{< ref "/riichi/rules/kan.md" >}}) with an ankan, or closed
kan. However, this is invalid when the player's [wait]({{< ref "/riichi/strategy/machi.md" >}})
changes. Typically, this occurs when, the four concealed tiles are connected to another [tile
grouping]({{< ref "/riichi/terminology/mentsu.md" >}}). Other players cannot detect this rules
violation immediately, and it is punished at the same time as a noten riichi.

**Example:** _Riichi is declared._ {{< t 22234p777m345s33z >}}

- {{< t 7m >}} If this tile is drawn, then it is acceptable to call kan in this instance.
- {{< t 2p >}} If this tile is drawn, then it is unacceptable to call kan. In fact, it is much
  better to simply call tsumo and win the hand.

### Calling with a dead hand

`main|Dead hand` A player with a dead hand is forbidden to make any type of call, such as chii, pon,
kan, riichi, tsumo, or ron.

### Wall destruction

A player may not crash and destroy the wall, such that the tile arrangement cannot be recovered.
This is by far one of the worst penalties, as the act ruins the game completely. It is worse, when
done intentionally. The intentional act of destroying the wall may be considered to be extremely
rude and renders an otherwise enjoyable game into a confrontational one. Here, a player may not just
incur a penalty but also be ejected.

## Rule variations

`main|Rule variations\#Chombo`

The enforcement of chombo may vary among different groups and play conditions. More casual games
and/or with newer players, the rule of chombo may be completely disregarded. Many will adopt the
mangan tsumo penalty, while others may enforce even stricter penalties. The enforcement of chombo
itself may be applied immediately upon the incursion or reserved for after the game. Also, the
amount penalized for chombo may vary. Some settings may punish offenders for amounts greater than
mangan. Overall, the enforcement and implementation of chombo depends on the setting.
