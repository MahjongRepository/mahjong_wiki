!Dead wall showing 2-pin as the dora indicator. in order to score, regardless of the number of dora
in the hand. So, the possession of dora is best considered as a bonus.

At the beginning of every hand, fourteen tiles are set aside as the wanpai, or dead wall tiles. The
dora is marked by the tile after the flipped tile. Additional dora may be revealed through the use
of **uradora** and/or **kandora**. Finally, additional tiles underneath any revealed dora may also
mark more dora as an added benefit for hands won with riichi.

## Yaku

`main|Yaku` In terms of value, dora are counted by measure of han. However, dora functions as a
"bonus value", where the hand simply cannot just possess dora in order to qualify as a winning hand.
The hand still requires **at least one yaku**. In other words, dora is not a replacement for the
yaku requirement.

## Wanpai

`main|Wanpai`

For every hand, fourteen tiles are always set aside to form the **dead wall**, or **wanpai**
{{< kana "王牌" >}}. One of these tiles, the third from the initial wall break as shown in the
picture, is always flipped over to indicate the dora.

## Dora order

This lists the complete dora order. As a repeat, the dora is the next tile within each of the
following orders. Dora are not "cross indicated" among the different suits. Furthermore, the dora
order loops.

### Suit order

{{< t 123456789m >}} If the dora indicator is {{< t 9m >}}, then the dora is {{< t 1m >}}.

{{< t 123456789p >}} If the dora indicator is {{< t 9p >}}, then the dora is {{< t 1p >}}.

{{< t 123456789s >}} If the dora indicator is {{< t 9s >}}, then the dora is {{< t 1s >}}.

### Wind order

{{< t 1234z >}} If the dora indicator is {{< t 4z >}}, then the dora is {{< t 1z >}}.

The wind order follows the same order as the seat winds in the same counterclockwise direction as
the normal turn order. Naturally, wind based dora are particularly advantageous to yakuhai. Yet,
players seated off wind can still use this dora while implementing the appropriate yaku.

### Dragon order

{{< t 567z >}} If the dora indicator is {{< t 7z >}}, then the dora is {{< t 5z >}}.

## Duplicated dora

In the event a dora indicator is repeated, either as a kandora or uradora, then the dora tile is
worth the number of han as the dora indicator shows.

**Example:**

- Dora indicators

<!-- end list -->

-

    {{< t 5s >}} {{< t 5s >}}

A single {{< t 6s >}} is worth 2 han.

## Other types of dora

Additional indicators of dora may be found in the game.

### Akadora

![Specially marked haku as dora, next to a standard haku tile.](Dora_Haku.jpg "Specially marked haku as dora, next to a standard haku tile.")
![Multiple dora shown due to [kan calls](http://tenhou.net/0/?log=2014081810gm-0009-7447-935af6c5&tw=1&ts=5).](Kandora.png "Multiple dora shown due to kan calls.")
**Akadora** {{< kana "赤ドラ" >}} or **akapai** {{< kana "赤牌" >}} are specifically marked red dora
tiles. If included in the game, these "red fives" automatically count as dora, regardless of the
dora indicator. If the dora indicator is a four, the red five of the same suit counts as two dora.
Most modern sets will include two red 5p, one red 5m, and one red 5s, and one red five of each suit
is used in actual play.

{{< t 0m0p0s >}}

Sets may include other tiles marked "red" as automatic dora. Five happens to be the common choice
because it is the center number within the 1 through 9 range. Though rarely found, some older sets
include a "red haku" tile (white dragon), with some marking not present on the usual haku tile, and
some sets include red threes.

### Uradora

**Uradora** {{< kana "裏ドラ" >}}, or **underneath dora** applies only to hands won using riichi.
Thus, no open hand may ever have access to the uradora. In the event a riichi declared hand has won,
the tiles underneath the dora indicator(s) are revealed. These newly revealed tiles serve as
additional dora indicators. Potentially, such hands may potentially gain substantial value, just off
of the uradora.

If there are multiple identical indicators, each indicated tile counts as multiple dora
correspondingly.

### Kandora

After a call for kan, additional dora indicators, called **kandora** {{< kana "カンドラ" >}}, are
revealed. These are tiles next to the dora indicator counter clockwise on the dead wall. Depending
on the rules and/or formality of the game, the timing for flipping the kandora during a kan
procedure may vary. Casual games will simply flip the kan dora immediately after kan. More technical
games will differentiate between the kan types, where the kan dora may be flipped after the player
makes a discard.

Likewise, in the event of riichi, the uradora underneath the kandora are also revealed, as
**kanuradora** {{< kana "カン裏ドラ" >}}.

### Nukidora

`main|Sanma`

In some rules of three-player mahjong, North tiles may be picked. The procedure is the same of
forming a added kan. The North tiles picked becomes doras.

## Strategy

`main|Dora strategy`

A number of strategic considerations surround dora tiles. Because of the 1-han value of a single
dora tile, players often desire them within their hands. This either involves possession of dora
tiles or potential waits involving dora tiles. Of course, in many instances, neither is the case.

## Rule variations

`main|Dora variations`

Rules variations allow the customization on the use of dora. Most commonly, the use of the initial
dora is generally universal within Japanese mahjong. As for the other sources of dora, such as the
kandora and uradora, some organizations would omit them. The most optional dora involve the akadora,
where tile sets are sold with the red dora as extra tiles.
