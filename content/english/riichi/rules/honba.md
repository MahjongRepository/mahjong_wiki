![Game extended to 10 honba [1](http://tenhou.net/0/?log=2014010103gm-00a9-0000-ca27a20c&tw=2&ts=9).](Honba_10.png "Game extended to 10 honba 1.")
**Honba** {{< kana "本場" >}} or **tsumibou count** is an added element to scoring, that awards
bonus points for particular repeats. **The honba count increases by one for the next hand according
to these three scenarios**:

- Exhaustive draw
- Abortive draw
- Dealer winning the hand

When any non-dealer wins a hand, then the honba count resets back down to zero.

**This count increases hand values by a total of 300 per honba**. For ron, the discarder pays the
additional 300 points. For tsumo, everyone pays an additional 100 each. These extra points are added
to the hand value after the capping as mangan, haneman, etc., so a non-dealer mangan tsumo with 2
honba costs 2,200 for a non-dealer and 4,200 for the dealer. In the case of sekinin barai, the
yakuman tsumo payment is borne entirely by the discarder of the ponned tile, who also has to pay 300
per honba. On a ron, the yakuman value is split between the discarder of the winning tile and the
discarder of the earlier ponned tile. Most rules have the winning tile discarder pay for all honba.

For online play, the honba count is automatically noted. However, with real tiles, the current
dealer indicates the honba count by using 100-point sticks and placing them on the dealer indicator
or on the table. These 100-point sticks are merely counters. If ryuukyoku occurs where the dealer is
not tenpai, then the wind seating rotates and the honba count increases by one. For any time the
wind seating rotates, the 100-point sticks are returned to the dealer; and the next dealer assumes
responsibility of tracking the honba count.

A custom rule named **basengo** {{< kana "場千五" >}} may be used, by which the honba value is five
times the normal value. With this rule, instead of 300 points per honba, it is 1500 points per
honba. This rule is not commonly used; and instead, it can be found under gambling situations.
