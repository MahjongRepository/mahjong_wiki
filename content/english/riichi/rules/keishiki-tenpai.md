**Keishiki tenpai** {{< kana "形式聴牌" >}}, or **shaped tenpai**, is otherwise known as a tenpai
hand with no yaku. Some cases of tenpai also involve waiting for a so-called fifth tile, which is
nonexistent. Strategically, players often push for late tenpai hands regardless of yaku state for
ryuukyoku to gain small points rather than lose them. This term can be shortened to **keiten** for
ease.

## Strategy

Players do not necessarily aim for keishiki tenpai until late into the hand. Usually, consideration
for such action begins on the third row of discards. Ryuukyoku imposes point gains or losses. Even
if minimal, players may find themselves motivated to be on the positive end of the exchange rather
than the negative. Plus, tenpai at ryuukyoku also provides a chance for either haitei or houtei to
outright win the hand. Finally, players opting for this push for tenpai must also be wary of players
already in tenpai, making defense considerations to be noted. With that said, it is preferable to
lose points via noten rather than dealing into larger hands.

## Rule variation

Some house rules factor keishiki tenpai into ryuukyoku, where hands even in tenpai may not receive
tenpai payment. Instead, the points for noten are deducted just because the hand lacks a yaku.
However, this practice is generally uncommon.
