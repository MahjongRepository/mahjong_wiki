**Ryanhan shibari** {{< kana "二飜縛り" >}} is a modified rule, which increases the han limit to
qualify for winning hands. In this rule, the minimum hand value is two han instead of one. In
addition, dora do not count for the han minimum. Some house rules apply this throughout the game.
Others, such as the EMA rules, apply it once the game reaches the fifth honba, to increase the
difficulty of dealer continuation.
