![[Point exchange at ryuukyoku](http://tenhou.net/0/?log=2014020716gm-0009-7447-c1bce130&tw=0).](Ryuukyoku.png "Point exchange at ryuukyoku.")
**Ryuukyoku** {{< kana "流局" >}} is also known as an **exhaustive draw**. Sometimes, [all the
tiles]({{< ref "/riichi/rules/haiyama.md" >}}) aside from the [dead
wall]({{< ref "/riichi/rules/wanpai.md" >}}) are drawn; and no player manages to produce a winning
hand. Points are exchanged based on the number of players with a
[tenpai]({{< ref "/riichi/strategy/tenpai.md" >}}) hand vs those who are in
[noten]({{< ref "/riichi/rules/ryuukyoku.md" >}}) (not tenpai).

In this case, players in tenpai' reveal their hands and receive points from those in noten. Players
in noten may choose to reveal their hands, but it is not required. Noten hands do not affect the
point exchanges, when revealed. Though, players in tenpai are not particularly required to reveal
their hands. Instead, they may opt to declare noten, despite having a tenpai hand. In exchange for
keeping the hand hidden, a player loses points.

[Wind seating]({{< ref "/riichi/strategy/jikaze.md" >}}) may or may not occur depending on the
[dealer's]({{< ref "/riichi/rules/oya.md" >}}) hand. If the dealer is tenpai, then the wind seating
does not rotate; and on the other hand, wind seating does rotate if the dealer fails to develop a
tenpai hand. Though rules may be modified to require the dealer to win the hand, rather than just
simply attaining tenpai.

While the term "ryuukyoku" is usually used to refer to an exhaustive draw in Japanese, on occasion
this may be ambiguous, as the term technically refers to any draw (cf. [tochuu
ryuukoku]({{< ref "/riichi/rules/tochuu-ryuukyoku.md" >}}), {{< kana "途中流局" >}}). When ambiguity
occurs, it may be referred to as **tsuujou no ryuukyoku** {{< kana "通常の流局" >}}, which
translates roughly as "usual kind of draw".

Nearly 40% of professional games go to an exhaustive draw due to players immediately [abandoning the
hand]({{< ref "/riichi/strategy/betaori.md" >}}) when a player
declares [riichi]({{< ref "/riichi/rules/riichi.md" >}}).

## Tenpai

`Main|Tenpai`

Tenpai is the state of the hand waiting on just one tile to claim for a win, either by draw or
discard. Even if the hand does not win, it can still be awarded a small amount of points at the end
of the hand, after all possible tiles are drawn and discarded. So, hands at tenpai during ryuukyoku
still has some value.

- {{< t 123p456m888s1155z >}} is tenpai, waiting on {{< t 1z >}} or {{< t 5z >}}.

<!-- end list -->

- {{< t 359p457m113s1277z >}} is noten.

### Point exchanges

If some players are tenpai and some are not, a total exchange of 3,000 points are evenly split
between the players in _tenpai_ players from the players in _noten_.

Point exchanges are as follows:

- 0 players in tenpai: No points exchanged.
- 1 player in tenpai: All players in noten pays 1,000 points to the tenpai player.
- 2 players in tenpai: Each player in noten pays 1,500 points, each player in tenpai receives 1,500
  points.
- 3 players in tenpai: The single player in noten plays 1,000 points to each player in tenpai.
- 4 players in tenpai: No points exchanged.

Sometimes, the ryuukyoku point exchanges is enough to determine the final position in games,
especially in [oorasu]({{< ref "/riichi/rules/end-game-scenarios.md" >}}) (the last hand). Dealers
in tight point races need to take particular note about the need to attain tenpai or allow the game
to end. It may be desirable to pass on a small winning hand in order to collect the payment from
noten players instead.

### Nagashi mangan

`main|Nagashi mangan`

A special case may occur where a player achieved [nagashi
mangan]({{< ref "/riichi/yaku/nagashi-mangan.md" >}}). Here, the payment exchange applied by
ryuukyoku is replaced by a "reverse mangan tsumo" payment. The dealer pays 4000, while the other two
players pay 2000 each. If the nagashi mangan is at the dealer position, then all three players pay
4000 each.

## Seat rotation

[Wind seat rotation]({{< ref "/riichi/strategy/jikaze.md" >}}) is dependent on the dealer's hand
state: tenpai or noten. If the dealer's hand is tenpai, then
[renchan]({{< ref "/riichi/rules/renchan.md" >}}) is applied and wind seating does not rotate. If
the dealer's hand is noten, then the wind seating rotates with an additional
[honba]({{< ref "/riichi/rules/honba.md" >}}) applied.

## Chombo

`main|Chombo`

Seldom, a player may actually call a noten riichi and the hand ends in ryuukyoku. Here, the player
in [riichi]({{< ref "/riichi/rules/riichi.md" >}}) reveals a noten and is penalized for
[chombo]({{< ref "/riichi/rules/chombo.md" >}}). No wind rotation is applied, and no point exchanges
are applied. The honba count is not increased. The next hand continues as if the chombo hand did not
even occur. Of course, the appropriate penalty for chombo is applied and the game continues.

## Hand progression

`main|Hanchan`

Often, a hand may end in a draw, where players had declared riichi. Any leftover
[riichi]({{< ref "/riichi/rules/riichi.md" >}}) bets on the table are placed near the counters until
collected by the winner of a hand. If the dealer is not in tenpai, then the seat winds rotate
normally. If the dealer is in tenpai, the seat winds remain the same for the next hand.

The count for [honba]({{< ref "/riichi/rules/honba.md" >}}) keeps track of the number of consecutive
hands, by which no one has won a hand. Every time ryuukyou or even [tochuu
ryuukyoku]({{< ref "/riichi/rules/tochuu-ryuukyoku.md" >}}) (abortive draw) occurs, this count
increases by one. Barring [house rules]({{< ref "/riichi/rules/variations/rule-variations.md" >}}),
the count may or may not increase regarding [chombo]({{< ref "/riichi/rules/chombo.md" >}}). When a
non-dealer player wins a hand, the count resets back to zero.

## Variation

Variation on ryuukyoku stems from the qualification of tenpai. Under some rules and conditions, some
hands may be declared as noten instead, even if they appear to be in tenpai.

{{< t 12m567p888s11z >}} {{< t 0z33m0z >}}

Some many consider this hand as noten, despite needing one tile for completion. However, that one
tile is one among the tiles called for a closed kan by the same player. The hand is also
[karaten]({{< ref "/riichi/terminology/karaten.md" >}}), or impossible to complete. All possible
tiles for completion are used with the dubious [kan]({{< ref "/riichi/rules/kan.md" >}}) call. So,
instead of gaining points, the player loses points at ryuukyoku.

{{< t 123333m567p888s11z >}}

At some point, the hand looked like this. As it stands, this hand is actually complete. The kan was
closed, and no [open call]({{< ref "/riichi/rules/naki.md" >}}) was made. The tiles already
constitute the necessary [tile groups]({{< ref "/riichi/terminology/mentsu.md" >}}) and the
[pair]({{< ref "/riichi/terminology/jantou.md" >}}). Therefore, the hand should have been properly
called for a win or tsumo instead.
