**Sanma** {{< kana "三麻" >}} is the three player variant to mahjong. Just like the regular four
player game, all yaku and standard rules apply to the game. Likewise, any house rules may apply.

## Rule modifications

Three player essentially plays like the regular four player game but with some changes.

- Chii disabled

<!-- end list -->

-


    Players cannot make the tile call of chii. Players can still call pon or kan for claiming discards.

<!-- end list -->

- Removal of one suit

<!-- end list -->

-


    Typically, the manzu suit is removed. Though, the terminals (1-man and 9-man) remain in order to retain the possibility for kokushi musou. However, the game loses sanshoku doujun.

<!-- end list -->

- The dead wall

<!-- end list -->

-


    The dead wall is arranged differently. The dead wall accommodates 8 rinshan draws rather than four. Thus, dora indicator is the the 5th tile from the wall break.

<!-- end list -->

- North tile dora

<!-- end list -->

-


    By use of kita {{< kana "キタ" >}}, possession of the north tile may be put to the side of the hand, like an open call; and it would be counted as dora. Plus, the player is also awarded an extra draw from the dead wall for that north tile.
    If the player wins off of the dead wall draw from calling kita, they are awarded rinshan.
    A kita call can be ronned, but this does not award chankan.

<!-- end list -->

- Scoring

<!-- end list -->

-


    For scoring, the same scoring table is used. Both ron and tsumo values remain the same. However, for tsumo, no change is used to account and adjust for the missing player. Therefore, the total points for tsumo is less than that of the ron total.

## Play differences

Due to one less suit and fewer tiles, hands tend to develop much faster. In turn, players get the
tendency to push for tenpai more aggressively. With the application of the nuki dora, values tend to
become inflated. Hands of mangan or higher become more frequent.

## Variants

`Main|Atama mahjong`

One variant to sanma is called **atama mahjong**. The same mechanics to atama applies with an added
feature: tile calls from single tiles to complete pairs is allowed.
