**Tonpuusen** {{< kana "東風戦" >}} consists of a game that ends after the east round. A full
[hanchan]({{< ref "/riichi/rules/hanchan.md" >}}) of the game may take a long time, anywhere between
one hour to an hour and a half even among fast players. An east round only game may naturally cut
the duration in half. While a full hanchan may extend into the overtime west round if necessary, the
south round in this case works in the same manner.

## Strategy differences compared to hanchan

Under hanchan, players have the opportunity to be oya (dealer) twice. In tonpuusen, however, that is
not the case. Everyone has the chance to be dealer only once.
