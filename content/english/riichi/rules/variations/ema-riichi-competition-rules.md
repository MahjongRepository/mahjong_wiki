The **Riichi Competition Rules** (RCR) of the European Mahjong Association (EMA) are used for many
Japanese Mahjong tournaments throughout Europe.

## Introduction

### From 2008 until 2016

The EMA has used a ruleset over the course of its first 8 years of accepting riichi in its
organization that was unique compared to other competitive riichi rules. The main differences of the
RCR to other common Japanese Mahjong rulesets are:

- Kuitan nashi: Tanyao (all simples) was only awarded to closed hands only.
- Kuikae ari: Any discard is legal after calling chii or pon, even a tile which would also have
  completed the open meld.
- Ryanhan shibari: With five or more table counters present, winning hands must have at least two
  Han from Yaku.
- Furiten treatment: Temporary furiten is treated like ippatsu, a call from any opponents can
  nullify a temporary furiten state, unlike everywhere else requiring that the furiten player take
  his own action before exiting the furiten state. Permanent and self-furiten are treated the same.

### Current (2016+)

The most recent update to the EMA ruleset has made a number of changes, to resemble the standard set
by the WRC rules. The remaining differences with the 2015 WRC ruleset are minimal

- Changes from previous EMA rules (2012): no more red fives; open tanyao (kuitan) allowed; renhou is
  now a strict mangan only; the maximum score is a single yakuman (Daisuushii no longer worth
  double); 11-han hands and above are all scored as sanbaiman; the timing rule was changed; no more
  swap-calling (kuikae); temporary furiten ends once the player can play their turn (draw or claim a
  tile); the 2-han restriction (ryanhan shibari) with 5 or more repeats is gone; no more abortive
  draws; no more nagashi mangan; rank bonus (uma) is now \[+15P, +5P, -5P, -15P\]; the chombo
  penalty in a tournament is now -20P (after rank bonus); penalties are generally less harsh.
- Differences with WRC rules (2015):
  - Multiple winners are allowed
  - _4 han, 30 fu_ is not rounded to mangan payment
  - Timing rules differ; EMA: pung takes predence over chow
  - Riichi bets at game end go to the winner

## Detailed rules

The reader is assumed to be familiar with the general rules of Japanese Mahjong. This section
describes possible differences to other common rulesets.

This description tries to cover many possible questions, thus enabling a player to participate in an
EMA tournament, but it also strives to be concise. For the most elaborate rules, see the official
EMA RCR rules text, linked at the bottom of this page.

### Play

The tileset includes one red five per suit.

Turn order is considered interrupted by any call of Chii, Pon, or Kan, even when declaring a
concealed kan.

After calling Pon or Chii, any tile may be discarded by the caller. It is therefore legal to discard
the same tile as the one called, or a tile which would have completed the now-open meld on the other
side.

Ura dora, kan dora, and kan ura dora are used. After declaring any type of kantsu, the next dora
indicator is flipped immediately.

Abortive draws are no longer used in EMA riichi rules.

Double and triple Ron is allowed, the discarder has to pay each winner separately.

Temporary Furiten is cancelled when the player takes a tile from the wall, and also on any
interruption of turn order.

A player is karaten (empty tenpai) if his hand could be completed with one more tile, but all
possible winning tiles are already used in his own hand. Open melds and kantsu belong to his hand.
Karaten counts as noten.

### Yaku

Open tanyao is allowed.

Nagashi mangan counts as a win, rendering noten penalties and noten riichi chombo void. Multiple
players may win with Nagashi Mangan simultaneously, payments occur as with separate mangan Tsumos.
Table counters affect the hand score normally. Hand progression or hand repeat depends on whether
East was a nagashi mangan winner or not, because tenpai hands are not revealed.

Rinshan kaihou combines with Haitei when a kan is declared with exactly one tile in the live wall
and the declarer wins on the subsequent dead wall draw. This is not possible in most other rulesets.

Renhou is a mangan. This is awarded to any player winning by Ron within the first uninterrupted set
of turns, before the player has made his first draw from the wall. The winner does not need to have
another yaku, Renhou by itself is the yaku.

Sekinin barai, or pao, is in effect for daisangen and daisuushii.

Yakuman are not cumulative. Daisuushii is the only possible double yakuman.

### Scoring

Scores are kept on paper, there are no point sticks. Players start with 0 points and may sink into
negative scores without ending the game.

Players may declare Riichi with any score. Tournaments often provide each player with a single
1,000-point-stick for Riichi declarations. Winning players always get one Riichi stick back.
Leftover Riichi sticks go to the winner sitting closest to the discarder's right.

Table counters are added whenever East won a hand, or there was an exhaustive or abortive draw.
Table counters are all removed when someone else than East wins and East does not. Chombo leads to a
repetition of the hand with the same number of table counters.

When five or more table counters are present, winning hands must have at least two han, coming from
yaku.

After each Hanchan, players receive a relatively large uma of 5-15, i.e., the second player receives
5,000 points from the third, and the first player receives 15,000 points from last place. When
player scores tie, the tying players share their Uma; ties are not resolved by player seating order.
Players tying for first share any leftover Riichi sticks. There is no oka. Scores are _not_ rounded
to the nearest thousand.

### Time limit

When played with a time limit, a gong sounds 15 minutes before end. Only one more valid hand may be
started after the gong. A hand starts when the dice are thrown. Won hands, exhaustive draws, and
abortive draws all constitute a valid hand. Chombo renders a hand invalid, therefore another hand
must be played.
