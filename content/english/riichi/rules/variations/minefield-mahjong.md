**Minefield mahjong** is a specialized [mahjong]({{< ref "/riichi/rules/japanese-mahjong.md" >}})
variant found in the anime and manga series, Kaiji. This variant features two players, who take 34
tiles and arrange 13 of them into a [tenpai]({{< ref "/riichi/strategy/tenpai.md" >}}) hand. Any
remaining tiles are used as player discards, where the players take turns making their discards. In
a sense, this can be interpreted as a tile discard reading drill for
[defense]({{< ref "/riichi/strategy/defense.md" >}}) practice.

## Rules

- Players gather 34 tiles.
- Of the 34, 13 tiles are used to form a tenpai hand.
- Remaining tiles are to be used for discards.
- Players take turns making those discards.
- Order of which player makes the first discard may be determined using various methods, such as the
  dice roll or a coin flip.
- Naturally, if a discarded tile is a winning tile, then [ron]({{< ref "/riichi/rules/naki.md" >}})
  may be called.
- A player may not win with one's own discard; or a player cannot call
  [tsumo]({{< ref "/riichi/terminology/tsumo.md" >}}).
- If a winning tile is discarded, then [furiten]({{< ref "/riichi/strategy/furiten.md" >}}) is
  invoked.
- An additional rule to the hand formation may require players to produce a
  [mangan]({{< ref "/riichi/strategy/scoring-table.md" >}}) or better hand.

### Variation

If desired, players can default the setting for automatic
[riichi]({{< ref "/riichi/rules/riichi.md" >}}) upon the first discard. In effect, that's a [double
riichi]({{< ref "/riichi/yaku/daburu-riichi.md" >}}). This is for the purpose of just adding value.

The mangan rule may be turned off for greater hand variation. For a challenge, players can add the
dice roll to determine the hand's minimum han value.
