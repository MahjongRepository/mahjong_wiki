!Combination of
[Chinrotou and [Suukantsu]({{< ref "/riichi/yakuman/suukantsu.md" >}}) in this one hand [1](http://tenhou.net/0/?log=2013020807gm-0009-7447-8494ff98&tw=2&ts=2).](MrZen.png "Combination of Chinrotou and Suukantsu in this one hand 1.")
**Multiple yakuman** involve hands with more than one
[yakuman]({{< ref "/riichi/yaku/list-of-yaku.md" >}}), as the name implies. While regular yaku may
be stacked in one hand to raise value, the same can be done with different yakuman, where
applicable.

In terms of scoring, the number of yakuman in the hand serves as a multiplier to the base yakuman
point value. As a result, extremely high scoring hands are made possible.

If, in addition to one or more regular yakuman, the hand would also be a [kazoe
yakuman]({{< ref "/riichi/yakuman/kazoe-yakuman.md" >}}), no extra yakuman is added for this. For
regular yakuman, [han]({{< ref "/riichi/strategy/japanese-mahjong-scoring-rules.md" >}}) from normal
yaku and dora are not counted.

## Scoring

Application of the multiple yakuman may vary, as some rules do not allow multiple yakuman in terms
of [scoring]({{< ref "/riichi/strategy/japanese-mahjong-scoring-rules.md" >}}). This is largely due
to the extremely high value applied by multiple yakuman. In this case, even if the hand is composed
of multiple yakuman, the score payout may be capped.

### Single yakuman cap

Many professional organizations in Japan limit all payouts to a single yakuman, being 32,000 point
for nondealer and 48,000 points for the [dealer]({{< ref "/riichi/strategy/jikaze.md" >}}). This
means that there are no double yakuman, and yakuman are not cumulative.

### Cumulative single yakuman

Some groups, most notably [Tenhou.net]({{< ref "/riichi/" >}}), do not award double yakuman for any
specific hand. However, multiple yakuman are still possible, if two (or more) different yakuman are
completed in the same hand. Most commonly, this involves
[tsuuiisou]({{< ref "/riichi/yakuman/tsuuiisou.md" >}}) alongside either
[shousuushii]({{< ref "/riichi/yakuman/suushiihou.md" >}}) or
[daisangen]({{< ref "/riichi/yakuman/daisangen.md" >}}). Other combinations are possible, but they
are very rare.

### Full scoring

Under full scoring rules, four yakuman patterns may produce specific instances, that are worth
double yakuman. Under this ruleset, the combination of yakuman are applied. In addition,
particularly rare and difficult hands are worth double the score value of a normal yakuman by
themselves.

- [Daisuushii]({{< ref "/riichi/yakuman/suushiihou.md" >}}) is more difficult to complete than the
  lesser hand [shousuushii]({{< ref "/riichi/yakuman/suushiihou.md" >}}). Accordingly, daisuushii is
  worth double.
- [Kokushi musou]({{< ref "/riichi/terminology/waits/kokushi-musou.md" >}}) is double yakuman when
  completed on a 13-sided wait.
- [Chuuren poutou]({{< ref "/riichi/yakuman/chuuren-poutou.md" >}}) is double yakuman when completed
  on a 9-sided wait.
- [Suuankou]({{< ref "/riichi/yakuman/suuankou.md" >}}) is double yakuman when completed on a
  [tanki]({{< ref "/riichi/terminology/waits/tanki.md" >}}) wait. This is also the only way that the
  hand can win by [ron]({{< ref "/riichi/rules/naki.md" >}}).

If the optional yaku [daichisei]({{< ref "/riichi/yakuman/tsuuiisou.md" >}}) is being used, since it
is necessarily a special case of the single yakuman
[tsuuiisou]({{< ref "/riichi/yakuman/tsuuiisou.md" >}}), this is another case where a single yakuman
can be upgraded to double yakuman.

### Point values

Yakuman [point values]({{< ref "/riichi/strategy/scoring-table.md" >}}) are transferred as follows:

{{< table >}}

| Dealer ron                | Dealer tsumo            | Non-dealer ron            | Non-dealer tsumo                                   |
| ------------------------- | ----------------------- | ------------------------- | -------------------------------------------------- |
| 48,000 from the discarder | 16,000 from all players | 32,000 from the discarder | 16,000 from the dealer; 8,000 from the non-dealers |

{{</ table >}}

With multiple yakuman, point values are based on the yakuman point values and multiplied by the
applied number of yakuman in the hand. With the single yakuman cap, this multiplier is irrelevant.
