**Wanpai** {{< kana "王牌" >}} are the tiles used to form the **dead wall**. Every mahjong hand
session has 14 tiles, or 7 double-stacked tiles, set aside from the regular tile draw and discard
processes. These tiles are considered to be out of play, hence the nomenclature "dead wall". Most of
these tiles are used to indicate dora. The rest are used for kan draws and tile wall replacements.

## Arrangement

![Dead wall showing 2-pin as the dora indicator.](Dora_and_Wanpai.jpg "Dead wall showing 2-pin as the dora indicator.")
The fourteen tiles for the dead wall are arranged accordingly. Also, the last four tiles to the live
wall are also included.

{{< table >}}

| Dead wall    |              | End of live wall |
| ------------ | ------------ | ---------------- |
| {{< t 0z >}} | {{< t 0z >}} | {{< t 2p >}}     |
| 1st kan draw | 3rd kan draw | Dora indicator   |
| {{< t 0z >}} | {{< t 0z >}} | {{< t 0z >}}     |
| 2nd kan draw | 4th kan draw | 1st uradora      |

{{</ table >}}

For every hand, the dead wall always starts with the very same arrangement. The kan draws are always
the four tiles clockwise to the dora indicator. These are the **rinshanpai** {{< kana "嶺上牌" >}},
which are only accessible via calls for kan. Not necessary but recommended, the first kan draw can
be placed to the side of the second kan draw, like in the image to the right. This is to prevent
accidental revealing of that first tile, in case it gets knocked off.

### Dora

`main|Dora`

The dead wall is always responsible for indicating the dora. Ten of the fourteen original dead wall
tiles are used to indicate dora. The first one is always revealed at the start of the hand. This
tile is assigned as the **dorahyouji** {{< kana "ドラ表示" >}}, or "dora indicator". It is always
the third tile on the top row from the initial wall break. Tiles marked as dora are indicated as the
next tile in the sequence, as noted in the "dora order". Additional dora may be revealed by calls
for kan; and any tile underneath the revealed dora may be used in the event of winning riichi hands.
Rarely, all ten dora tiles are revealed for a single hand; but it is possible.

### Haiteihai

`main|Haiteihai`

The tile immediately before the dead wall is called the **haiteihai** {{< kana "海底牌" >}}. When a
kan is made, the current haiteihai will be moved into the dead wall; and the tile before it becomes
the new haiteihai. Barring those kan calls, the last four tiles can individually be marked as the
haiteihai, as one after the other are transferred to the dead wall. Only one tile at a time can be
designated as this last tile.

### Kan

`main|Kan`

Calls for kan affect the dead wall in three ways:

1.  The player calling kan is then required to draw from the dead wall via the rinshanpai.
2.  A tile from the back end of the wall, the haiteihai, is transferred to the dead wall.
3.  The tile next to the dora is revealed.

For every kan call, a player gains access to the dead wall and draws one rinshanpai. If the
rinshanpai produces a winning tile, then this draw invokes the yaku, rinshan kaihou. Under most
cases, players make a discard afterwards. After that discard, one tile from the end of the regular
wall is added to the dead wall to the back end. This is to retain the count of 14-tiles. Unlike the
original dead wall tiles, the added tiles can serve no function, other than as replacement tiles.
Finally, an additional dora indicator is revealed.
