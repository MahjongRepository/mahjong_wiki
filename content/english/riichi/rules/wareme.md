**Wareme** {{< kana "割れ目" >}} is rarely used optional rule. This rule centers on the dice roll,
used to indicate the wall break. The player, whose wall is broken, may receive double the points for
winning hands. However, the reverse also occurs, where the player pays twice as normal. Typically,
this rule is used under gambling settings or players seeking more chaotic and more devastating
effects on scoring.
