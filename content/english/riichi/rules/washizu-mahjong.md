!Transparent Jihai in Washizu Mahjong play, where three tiles for every tile type are transparent.
As a consequence, players are able to see most of the other players' hands. That aspect alone alters
player approaches to the game in both terms of play style and strategy. The variant originated from
the key arc of the 1991 manga series Akagi.

## Main game rule differences

The main rules to the game is retained. Rules dictating yaku, furiten, completed hands, and any
selected rule variations still apply. Nevertheless, the game is significantly altered.

Game processes are altered, because three-fourths of the tiles are transparent. The tiles are not
set up in walls. Likewise, a physical dead wall is not used either. Instead, all the tiles are mixed
into a non-transparent bag for players to draw from. To draw tiles, players wear gloves to draw
tiles and not read them with the hand. Finally, to mark a dora, one tile is automatically drawn at
the beginning of the game. Additional dora as either kandora or any uradora, they are drawn in a
similar fashion.
