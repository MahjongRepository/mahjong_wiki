!Transparent Jihai in Washizu Mahjong play, where three tiles for every tile type are transparent.
As a consequence, players are able to see most of the other players' hands. That aspect alone alters
player approaches to the game in both terms of play style and strategy. The variant originated from
the key arc of the 1991 manga series
[Akagi]({{< ref "/riichi/media/akagi-yami-ni-oritatta-tensai.md" >}}).

## Main game rule differences

The main rules to the game is retained. Rules dictating [yaku]({{< ref "/riichi/yaku/yaku.md" >}}),
[furiten]({{< ref "/riichi/strategy/furiten.md" >}}), completed hands, and any selected [rule
variations]({{< ref "/riichi/rules/variations/rule-variations.md" >}}) still apply. Nevertheless,
the game is significantly altered.

Game processes are altered, because three-fourths of the tiles are transparent. The tiles are not
set up in walls. Likewise, a physical [dead wall]({{< ref "/riichi/rules/wanpai.md" >}}) is not used
either. Instead, all the tiles are mixed into a non-transparent bag for players to draw from. To
draw tiles, players wear gloves to draw tiles and not read them with the hand. Finally, to mark a
[dora]({{< ref "/riichi/rules/dora.md" >}}), one tile is automatically drawn at the beginning of the
game. Additional dora as either [kandora]({{< ref "/riichi/rules/dora.md" >}}) or any
[uradora]({{< ref "/riichi/rules/dora.md" >}}), they are drawn in a similar fashion.
