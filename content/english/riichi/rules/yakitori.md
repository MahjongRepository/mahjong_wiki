![Yakitori markers.](Yakitori.jpg "Yakitori markers.")
**Yakitori** {{< kana "焼き鳥" >}} is a game state, where a player failed to win a hand during the course of a game. In many cases, this sort of game may leave a player feeling rather "empty". In some gambling situations, playing a yakitori game may result in a penalty after the game with a specified severity. Sometimes, players may use specialized "yakitori markers" as indicators. The instant a player wins a hand, then the marker is flipped over.

Usually, yakitori does not result in a winning game. A exceptionally rare exception would involve a game with point gains via ryuukyoku while avoiding any point losses and opposing players won hands with meager gains.
