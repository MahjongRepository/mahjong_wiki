**Jigoku** {{< kana "地獄" >}} is a special case of tanki wait where two of the winning tiles are
visible to all the players either in a discard pool or used as a dora indicator. This means that
there is only one winning tile left.

## Background

The meaning of jigoku wait has undergone some changes over time. It commonly refers to any tanki
wait as long as two copies of the winning tiles are visible, but it used to refer only to the case
where the winning tile is **shaa** (「西」 or **west**) or other honor tile. Some people now started
to use the term to refer to non-tanki waits where there is only one winning tile left. This usage is
technically incorrect and misleading for the following reason. The basic idea behind jigoku wait is
that the winning tile appears safe in the eyes of the opponents, so that whoever deals in to a
jigoku wait will feel like they fall into hell. For example, when two copies of an honor tile are
already discarded, the third copy of that honor tile looks safe because it can only be claimed for a
ron if someone has a tanki wait with the fourth copy of it. However, just because there is one
winning tile left does not make that tile appear safer. For this reason, some people still think
that the term jigoku wait should not be used to refer to numbered tile tanki wait except when all
the other wait patterns are negated by suji and kabe.

## Wait strength

Aside from karaten, this is the weakest choice for a wait, because of the number of available tiles
to win: one. However, the solitary tile may actually be strong, as players may view it as a safe
tile; and therefore, one player may discard it. The wait would be better still with the addition of
suji and/or kabe, or even with an honor tile with two already discarded. In essence, choosing this
wait may come in the form of a trap, luring unsuspecting players. This wait is best used for
emergency situations, such as being in last place at oorasu and other dire circumstances.
