The mechanics of calling for [kan]({{< ref "/riichi/rules/kan.md" >}}) requires some assessment, as
risks are involved. In plenty of cases, a kan is a risky move, even though there are potential
benefits.

## Offense

Under most circumstances, the call for kan is an offensive move. The player gets an extra draw from
the [rinshanpai]({{< ref "/riichi/yaku/rinshan-kaihou.md" >}}) and chances for the kandora. If the
hand is tenpai, then the hand has a chance for [rinshan
kaihou]({{< ref "/riichi/yaku/rinshan-kaihou.md" >}}).

### Aiding a player

## Defense

A safe place for dangerous tiles is in one's own hand. A call for ankan ensures for all four of a
single tile type to remain in the hand. Furthermore, it may be possible to apply
[kabe]({{< ref "/riichi/strategy/kabe.md" >}}) making appropriate tiles look safer. For the other
kan types, the hand is already open. In the case for daiminkan, the hand is either already open or
about to be opened. If the tile to be called is already a safe tile, then it may be a better idea to
not call, as three safe tiles are already in possession. For shouminkan or kakan, the added risk of
chankan is applied.

### Declining

An interesting consideration is to decline kan. This may be possible in one of two ways: Discarding
the fourth tile, or simply holding on to it. Doing so prevents additional dora indicators, which
could be favorable to opponents. The tile itself may be dangerous. If the hand is undergoing
betaori, then there is no interest for kan in the first place.

### Call timing

A player may have a hand warranting for kan. Given that the play is discretionary, it may not be
necessary to call kan immediately. Though, the delay of the call may actually affect tile efficiency
if the extra tile is not connected to another tile in the hand.

## Kandora

`main|Kandora`

Extra dora indicators are shown due to calls for kan. This is the **kandora**. While a player may
chance to receive extra dora, an equal chance applies to grant other players the extra dora. With
that said, extra consideration must be taken when given the opportunity to call kan.
