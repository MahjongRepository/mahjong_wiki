![Sashikomi utilized, while ending the game.](Sashikomi.png "Sashikomi utilized with minimal risk of gyakuten, while ending the game.")
**Sashikomi** {{< kana "差し込み" >}} is the deliberate act of dealing dangerous tiles, in order for
another player to win the hand. Normally, players with a large enough point difference can afford
the point loss and retain placement. The primary purpose of this strategy intends to either force a
wind rotation or outright end the game.

## Usage

To use this strategy, a player must either have a sizable lead, a marginal point lead vs the next
player in placement, and/or familiarity with the [scoring
table]({{< ref "/riichi/strategy/scoring-table.md" >}}). Furthermore, the player must defend against
particular players; or else the strategy is rendered moot by not accomplishing its goal. For
example, for the last hand of the game, players should defend against the last dealer in order to
prevent [additional hands]({{< ref "/riichi/rules/renchan.md" >}}); and otherwise, the last dealer
has a chance to win the game by winning enough consecutive and/or large enough hands as the last
dealer.
