**Ukeire** {{< kana "受け入れ" >}} factors the number of tiles needed to improve the hand and ultimately to tenpai. Normally, this is under consideration with hand shapes of 2-shanten or less. Hand shapes of 3-shanten or more produces very large ukeire counts, making it unnecessary to even be aware of the count during the game.
