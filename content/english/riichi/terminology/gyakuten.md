![Discarded winning tile may not be enough for [gyakuten](http://tenhou.net/0/?log=2014073113gm-0089-0000-b078ae6a&tw=0).](Ron_question.png "Discarded winning tile may not be enough for gyakuten.")
**Gyakuten** {{< kana "逆転" >}} is an instance, where a player had passed up the placement of
another player during the last hand. Players can either "luck" their way for a last minute win (or
improvement in placement); or, they can know the points table. The latter can produce an advantage
by having a better idea on the needed tile composition as well as other key decision making options,
especially riichi.

## Strategy for oorasu

The term normally applies to the last hand of the game. If a player manages to pass up a another
player's placement position in this last hand, then the chance to lose the new position is
eliminated because the game had ended. Either way, given the last hand, lower placed players must
develop their hands in a way, such that gyakuten is possible. On the other hand, players with their
desired standing must find a way to retain their position at the end of the game, either by winning
the final hand or simply avoid losing points.

## Score differences

With essentially the last hand of the game, players have one chance left to make a difference in the
game. With that, awareness of point difference is key, which links directly to values from the
scoring table. Here, minimal hand values are considered at the very least in order for players to
surpass others higher in placement.

### Gyakuten table

Using the values from the scoring table, point differences can tell players, which hand values are
necessary to accomplish surpassing leading players.
