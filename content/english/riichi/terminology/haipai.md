![[Sample starting hand](http://tenhou.net/0/?log=2015012621gm-0089-0000-5659a0d3&tw=2).](Haipai.png "Sample starting hand.")
**Haipai** {{< kana "配牌" >}} are the first thirteen tiles dealt to a player's hand. In other
words, these tiles compose the **start hand**. In the case for the dealer, this would be fourteen as
the dealer is required to take the first draw before discarding. To speed up the process, the dealer
is allowed to take the initial draw as the tiles are dealt. Given these tiles, players are given the
task to best manage the hand either by attempting to bring the hand to
[tenpai]({{< ref "/riichi/strategy/tenpai.md" >}}) and/or defending the hand by avoiding dealing
into another player's hand ([ron]({{< ref "/riichi/rules/naki.md" >}})).

## Assessing a haipai

Once the tiles are dealt, players have the task of assessing their staring hand. If a player so
chooses, the tiles may be arranged and organized. However, by any means, a player is not required to
do so. An organized hand is simply easier to look at and assess; though some players have the
ability to perform this task with a jumbled hand.

Upon receiving the haipai, players must consider various things:

- Is tenpai reasonably attainable?
- If so, what is the best and [most efficient]({{< ref "/riichi/strategy/tile-efficiency.md" >}})
  way to attain tenpai?
- Is the hand already in [tenpai]({{< ref "/riichi/strategy/tenpai.md" >}}) (or, for the dealer, is
  the hand [already complete]({{< ref "/riichi/yakuman/tenhou-and-chiihou.md" >}}))?
- Which [yaku]({{< ref "/riichi/yaku/yaku.md" >}}) are the most viable?
- Should the hand remain closed, or is open play the best option?
- What is the current round and score?

Naturally, the eventual tile draws and discard may dictate changes to this initial assessment. It is
up to the player to maintain awareness and change along with the tiles themselves.

## Tenhou, chiihou, and renhou

`main|Tenhou and chiihou|Renhou` Under three instances, it is possible for a player to win a hand
before ever discarding from the wall. In the case for renhou, the hand wins before ever taking a
drawn tile. In these cases, the haipai is already at tenpai; and the hand won upon the first draw or
discard.
