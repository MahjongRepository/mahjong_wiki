**Jihai** {{< kana "字牌" >}} are the **honor tiles**. Sometimes, they are referred to as **word
tiles** or **characters**, although the latter term should be avoided because it can also be used
for the [manzu]({{< ref "/riichi/rules/mahjong-equipment.md" >}}). Unlike the numbered suits, these
tiles cannot be mixed together to form sequences. Instead, to use them in a complete hand, identical
groups must be made in triplets, quads, or [the pair]({{< ref "/riichi/terminology/jantou.md" >}}).
or alternatively all seven of them can be used to complete [kokushi
musou]({{< ref "/riichi/terminology/waits/kokushi-musou.md" >}}). This class of mahjong tiles is
subdivided into two smaller groups: the **sangenpai**, or **dragons**, and the **kazehai**, or
**winds**.

All of the sangenpai and some of the jihai can be used to score the yaku
[yakuhai]({{< ref "/riichi/rules/yakuhai.md" >}}). A hand consisting entirely of jihai scores a
yakuman for [tsuuiisou]({{< ref "/riichi/yakuman/tsuuiisou.md" >}}).

## Sangenpai

`sangenpai|English|right`

The **sangenpai** {{< kana "三元牌" >}} (lit. _three foundation tiles_) are three tiles, originally
representing the three Confucian values. These tiles are quite distinctive, often brightly coloured.
In English, they are most often referred to as the **dragons**, but occasionally they are referred
to as the **colours**.

**Haku** {{< kana "白" >}}, the **white dragon**, is usually depicted by an entirely blank tile in
Japanese-style sets. In Chinese-style sets, it is more frequently depicted as a blue or black border
around nothing, although those sets often come with blank replacement tiles which can be used
instead. In some Japanese-style sets, especially those where the front and back of the tile are the
same colour, haku will have a gem in the center. **Chun** {{< kana "中" >}}, the **red dragon**, and
**hatsu** {{< kana "發" >}}, the **green dragon**, are depicted by their respective kanji although,
especially with hatsu, they may be stylized. Chun is usually written in red, and hatsu is often,
though not always, written in green.

The sangenpai are traditionally ordered haku, hatsu, chun, as in the table on the right. When one
appears as a [dora]({{< ref "/riichi/rules/dora.md" >}}) indicator, the dora tile is the next in
this sequence, with chun pointing back to haku.

The sangenpai are an easy way to score points. A [pair]({{< ref "/riichi/terminology/jantou.md" >}})
of any of them is worth 2 [fu]({{< ref "/riichi/yaku/fu.md" >}}) (although it means that
[pinfu]({{< ref "/riichi/yaku/pinfu.md" >}}) cannot be scored), and a
[group]({{< ref "/riichi/terminology/mentsu.md" >}}) of them scores
[yakuhai]({{< ref "/riichi/rules/yakuhai.md" >}}), a [yaku]({{< ref "/riichi/yaku/yaku.md" >}})
worth 1 [han]({{< ref "/riichi/strategy/japanese-mahjong-scoring-rules.md" >}}). If a hand is lucky
enough to have two groups of dragons, as well as a pair of the third, it will score 2 han for
[shousangen]({{< ref "/riichi/yaku/shousangen.md" >}}) in addition to the yakuhai, for a minimum of
4 han. Completing all three groups of dragons produces the
[daisangen]({{< ref "/riichi/yakuman/daisangen.md" >}}) yakuman, one of the three most common.

Often, a hand scoring shousangen or daisangen will have two [visible
calls]({{< ref "/riichi/rules/naki.md" >}}) of dragons. Such a hand should be treated with extreme
caution by the other players if they cannot see many copies of the remaining type of dragon. The
hand may well be tenpai for shousangen or daisangen and, in games using
[pao]({{< ref "/riichi/rules/sekinin-barai.md" >}}), even if it is not tenpai, a player discarding
the remaining dragon risks becoming liable for a yakuman payment.

There is only one difference between the three sangenpai, and that is that hatsu can be used (and
sometimes is required) to score [ryuuiisou]({{< ref "/riichi/yaku/ryuuiisou.md" >}}), the yakuman
awarded for having a hand entirely consisting entirely of the tiles which are traditionally green.
Other than this rare case, the tiles are effectively interchangeable.

## Kazehai

`kazehai|English|right`

**Kazehai** {{< kana "風牌" >}} (lit. _wind tiles_) are four tiles representing winds in the four
cardinal directions. In the four directions are, in counterclockwise order, **ton**
{{< kana "東" >}} or **east**, **nan** {{< kana "南" >}} or **south**, **shaa** {{< kana "西" >}} or
**west**, and finally **pei** {{< kana "北" >}} or north. As many new players notice, the wind order
does not emulate the Western cardinal counterclockwise order of east, north, west, and south. One
way to remember the mahjong order is to imagine a compass rose written on the ceiling, above the
players. In English, the kazehai are referred to as the **winds** or, less commonly, as the
**directions**. The wind tiles are each depicted with their respective kanji, although usually in a
more stylized form than is common in modern Japanese.

The winds are special as they are the only tiles whose value changes throughout the game. One wind
is distinguished as **bakaze** {{< kana "場風" >}}, the **round wind** or **table wind**. This wind
is the same for all players at any given time, and corresponds to the current
[round]({{< ref "/riichi/rules/ba.md" >}}) of play. Additionally, for each player, one wind is
distinguished as **jikaze** {{< kana "自風" >}}, the **seat wind**. The
[dealer]({{< ref "/riichi/strategy/jikaze.md" >}}) is always east, and the directions continue
counterclockwise around the table, with the player to the dealer's right being south, the player
across being west, and the player on the dealer's left being north. As the deal rotates, so do the
wind positions. Winds which are neither bakaze nor jikaze are **otakaze** {{< kana "客風" >}}, **off
winds** or **guest winds**.

Only jikaze and bakaze are worth [fu]({{< ref "/riichi/yaku/fu.md" >}}) and
[yakuhai]({{< ref "/riichi/rules/yakuhai.md" >}}) in the manner of the dragons. For one player, the
round wind and seat wind will coincide; this **double wind** will score yakuhai twice, for 2
[han]({{< ref "/riichi/strategy/japanese-mahjong-scoring-rules.md" >}}), and a
[pair]({{< ref "/riichi/terminology/jantou.md" >}}) may score 4 fu rather than 2, depending on the
ruleset. Otakaze do not score any yakuhai and are therefore the weakest tiles in any hand: they can
only group with themselves and are worth no more points. Additionally, the presence of any jihai
means that [tanyao]({{< ref "/riichi/yaku/tanyao.md" >}}) cannot be scored, which makes it a common
strategy to discard otakaze immediately.

Similarly, an [open call]({{< ref "/riichi/rules/naki.md" >}}) of otakaze is extremely limiting to a
hand. The common yaku [riichi]({{< ref "/riichi/rules/riichi.md" >}}),
[pinfu]({{< ref "/riichi/yaku/pinfu.md" >}}), and [tanyao]({{< ref "/riichi/yaku/tanyao.md" >}})
become unscorable, and the call does not guarantee
[yakuhai]({{< ref "/riichi/rules/yakuhai.md" >}}). A hand that calls otakaze usually seeks to find a
yaku in [honitsu]({{< ref "/riichi/yaku/honiisou.md" >}}), or less commonly, in another
[yakuhai]({{< ref "/riichi/rules/yakuhai.md" >}}) or
[toitoi]({{< ref "/riichi/yaku/toitoihou.md" >}}), and likely means the hand will not be worth many
points, unless more winds are called.

A hand that completes [groups]({{< ref "/riichi/terminology/mentsu.md" >}}) of three of the winds,
plus a pair of the fourth, scores [yakuman]({{< ref "/riichi/yakuman/yakuman.md" >}}) for
[shousuushii]({{< ref "/riichi/yakuman/suushiihou.md" >}}). If the fourth pair is replaced with a
group of the last wind, the hand instead scores
[daisuushii]({{< ref "/riichi/yakuman/suushiihou.md" >}}), which is worth [double
yakuman]({{< ref "/riichi/rules/variations/multiple-yakuman.md" >}}) under many rulesets. A hand
that has made three [visible calls]({{< ref "/riichi/rules/naki.md" >}}) of winds should therefore
be treated as highly dangerous, unless the locations of at least three of the last wind are known.
When the [pao]({{< ref "/riichi/rules/sekinin-barai.md" >}}) rule is in use, a player who discards
the tile needed to complete the fourth group of winds will be liable to pay for the resulting
daisuushii hand, even if it was not then in tenpai.

When a wind tile is a [dora]({{< ref "/riichi/rules/dora.md" >}}) indicator, it points to the next
wind in the counter-clockwise order around the table.

## Machi

`main|Machi`

When in tenpai waiting on at least one honor tile, the hand uses one of three [waiting
patterns]({{< ref "/riichi/strategy/machi.md" >}}):
[shanpon]({{< ref "/riichi/terminology/waits/shanpon.md" >}}),
[tanki]({{< ref "/riichi/terminology/waits/tanki.md" >}}), or [kokushi
musou]({{< ref "/riichi/terminology/waits/kokushi-musou.md" >}}). This stems on the honor tiles'
inability to be used in sequences.
