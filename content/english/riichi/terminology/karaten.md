![Example of a karaten riichi, with all waiting tiles circled in red.](Dead_Wait.png "Example of a karaten riichi, with all waiting tiles circled in red.")
**Karaten** {{< kana "カラテン" >}}, or **empty tenpai**, is a state where a tenpai hand does not
have the ability to win. This is due to unavailability of all instances of winning tiles. The
"visible tiles" may either be discarded, used as a dora indicator, or already exist in one's hand.
Furthermore, they may be held in other player's hands or even reside within the dead wall. However,
the latter case is beyond a player's visibility.

## Ambiguity

The term is often confused with the "fifth tile" case. Here, a hand waiting for a fourth tile that
is simply hidden, discarded, or used by someone else remains a valid tenpai in all circumstances. A
hand may contain a 1-2 penchan and a previously declared kan of 3-3-3-3 in the same suit. This
renders the threes unavailable as winning tiles. Because of the prevalence of **keishiki tenpai**,
it is assumed that if the rule is different, it would be announced what qualifies as tenpai or not.
As a precaution, it is almost always mentioned.

**Example:**  
{{< t 12m444p678s1180z33m0z >}} Waiting for: {{< t 3m >}}

### Quirks

- On Ron2, there has been an instance of a person being able to call riichi with a gutshot wait
  shape for a 6-pin when they have made a closed kan of 6-pin already. The hand was considered
  noten, but did not trigger a chombo penalty (mainly due to programming assuming no one could do
  something that could be viewed as faulty). This conforms to the usual **keishiki tenpai**
  interpretation that the hand was not in a valid tenpai shape when it came to scoring a drawn hand,
  but not okay for determining if a player was legally allowed to declare riichi.
- On Tenhou, there have been reports of a hand containing 12s44466688p with a kan of 3s, scored as
  in tenpai. This does not conform to the usual **keishiki tenpai standard**. All hands that conform
  to **keishiki tenpai** are valid, as well as a few (such as the current case) that may not be.
