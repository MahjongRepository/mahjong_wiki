**Moupai** {{< kana "盲牌" >}} is the practice of reading mahjong tiles by touch. Normally, this act
utilizes the thumb and/or fingers. It is even possible to identify tiles by rubbing them on a play
surface.

## Drills

A number of tile reading drills can be practiced in order to become more familiar with the tiles by
touch. In a sense, they can be considered as minigames on their own.
