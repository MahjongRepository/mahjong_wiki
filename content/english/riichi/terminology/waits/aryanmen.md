**Aryanmen** {{< kana "亜両面" >}} is a variation on the ryanmen waiting pattern, where the two
tiles completing the sequence are next to a pair of one of the waiting tiles. As a result, the hand
also has a pair wait on that tile. It is generally a weaker wait, however, as the pair uses up two
of the eight possible waiting tiles, leaving only six possible tiles to win off of.

## Tile pattern

```machi
|pattern = 000z5567m000000z
|tilewaits = 58m
```

In this example, the underlying ryanmen wait is based on the 67m, but additionally, 567m can be
viewed as a complete sequence, in which case the other 5m creates a pair wait.

## Scoring

When aryanmen is won with the waiting tile not already present in hand, the wait can only be
interpreted as a ryanmen wait, and it will score 0 fu.

When aryanmen is won with the waiting tile already present in hand, it can be interpreted as either
a tanki or ryanmen wait. In this case, the highest-scoring option must be chosen. Normally, this
will be the 2 fu for a tanki wait, but if the hand qualifies for the pinfu yaku, that will be scored
instead.
