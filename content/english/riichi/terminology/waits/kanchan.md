**Kanchan** {{< kana "嵌張" >}} is a wait pattern that completes with the middle number of a
sequence.

## Pattern

{{< t 00000z46m000000z >}}

## Fu

`main|Fu`

Kanchan is awarded 2 fu upon winning. A closed hand winning by ron automatically becomes mangan, if
it scores 4 han.

## Strategy

Kanchan is similar to penchan, by which it waits on 4 tiles maximum for a single numbered tile type
for completion. Likewise, this pattern can hide against suji. However, kanchan is more versatile as
it is able to use a greater range of tile types.
