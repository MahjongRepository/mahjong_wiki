**Kokushi musou** {{< kana "国士無双" >}}, also simply known as **kokushi** or in English as
**thirteen orphans**, is one of the standard yakuman hands. It is one of the three **yakuman
gosanke** {{< kana "役満御三家" >}}, or "the three big families of yakuman". This hand is one of the
two exceptions of the "[four tile groups and one pair]({{< ref "/riichi/terminology/mentsu.md" >}})"
requirement for [tenpai]({{< ref "/riichi/strategy/tenpai.md" >}}) hands, where the other exception
is [chiitoitsu]({{< ref "/riichi/yaku/chiitoitsu.md" >}}).

## Composition

This yakuman is unique, as it requires of one of each
[terminal]({{< ref "/riichi/yakuman/chinroutou.md" >}}) tile from each suit and one of each of the
[honor tiles]({{< ref "/riichi/terminology/jihai.md" >}}). The 14th tile must be a duplicate of any
terminal or honor tile. These tiles are classed as **yaochuuhai** {{< kana "幺九牌" >}}. As the hand
requires specific individual tiles, this hand remains closed to qualify, due to the general
inability to call tiles in order to complete it. If a player draws the thirteen different tile types
before pairing any of them, then the hand is called **kokushi musou juusan menmachi**
{{< kana "国士無双１３面待ち" >}}, or the [kokushi musou 13 closed
wait]({{< ref "/riichi/strategy/machi.md" >}}).

## Tile diagram

The hand requires nothing but yaochuuhai.

### Kokushi musou 13-way wait

{{< t 19m19p19s1234567z >}} Winning tile: Any one of the tiles shown here

- Winning from this wait may be worth [two

## Meaning and usage

The word _kokushi_ can be translated as "distinguished citizen"; the word _musou_ is often
translated as "peerless". The word _kokushi_ should not split up and expressed as "Koku shimusou".
This is an incorrect spelling.

## Development

Restricted as closed only, this hand must draw at least 12 of the 13 tile types, among the honors
and terminals. If a pair exists within the hand upon
[tenpai]({{< ref "/riichi/strategy/tenpai.md" >}}), then naturally, the hand is waiting on the last
remaining tile type not yet in the hand. In turn, this hand will be deemed [impossible for
completion]({{< ref "/riichi/terminology/karaten.md" >}}), when all 4 of any of the tile types are
no longer available. Yet, if a player manages to develop the 13 wait variety, then this hand greatly
increases its chances of completion, needing to simply pair any of the 13 types.

Reasonable development of this hand begins with a dealt set of tiles that gives a player the option
to call [kyuushu kyuuhai]({{< ref "/riichi/rules/tochuu-ryuukyoku.md" >}}). Declining this option
puts the hand on the path to form this yakuman.

{{</ table >}}

Any player attempting kokushi musou makes the decision at the
[beginning]({{< ref "/riichi/terminology/haipai.md" >}}) of the hand. This decision stems on a
couple conditions, by which the primary decision rests on the number of unique yaochuhai at the
start. The points and the current hand also influences the decision. Sometimes, players need yakuman
in order to win or [improve point standing]({{< ref "/riichi/terminology/gyakuten.md" >}}).

On average, a hand ending in [exhaustive draw]({{< ref "/riichi/rules/ryuukyoku.md" >}}) ends with
roughly 16-19 tiles discarded per player, pending any tile calls. Therefore, every player has that
many tile draws to work with. For example, if a hand starts with 9 tiles for the yakuman, then it
requires 4 [tile draws]({{< ref "/riichi/strategy/shanten.md" >}}) searching for specific tiles.
Usually, barring unusual circumstances, those tile draws are nonconsecutive. If anything, a number
of tile draws will be required to even attain tenpai. With that said, the decision to form a kokushi
musou must be a decisive one at the [very beginning of the
hand]({{< ref "/riichi/terminology/haipai.md" >}}).

### Kyuushu kyuuhai

`main|Tochuu ryuukyoku`

Realistic chances to complete kokushi musou may require a hand to begin with at least 9 yaochuhai.
Even so, at this point, this gives a player the option to defer and abort the hand, rather than
trying for kokushi.

## Value

This hand is a yakuman hand. When dealer, the hand scores 48,000 points. For non-dealers, the hand
scores 32,000. Some rules may apply double yakuman for the 13-wait variety.

## Chankan rule variation

![Case where a [closed kan]({{< ref "/riichi/rules/kan.md" >}}) was declared during a [kokushi tenpai](http://tenhou.net/0/?log=2013121107gm-0019-0000-b01e54cd&tw=1&ts=7).](Kokushi_Denied.png "Case where a closed kan was declared during a kokushi tenpai.")
Under some rules, a kokushi tenpai hand may win via [chankan]({{< ref "/riichi/yaku/chankan.md" >}})
off a closed kan made with the winning tile. When allowed, this is an exception to the usual rule
that [ron]({{< ref "/riichi/rules/naki.md" >}}) may be called off of the tile used to form an added
kan, but not a closed kan. This rule, although not universal, is fairly common.
