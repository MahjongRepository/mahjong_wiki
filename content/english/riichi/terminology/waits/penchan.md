```

A **penchan machi** {{< kana "辺張待ち" >}} is a common type of wait pattern. This wait pattern
contains the tiles 1 and 2 of the same suit, or 8 and 9 of the same suit. The pattern is limited to
waiting for the completion of the shuntsu with a 3 or 7. At maximum, only four tiles are available
for completion.

## Pattern

{{< t 00000000000z12s >}}, winning tile: {{< t 3s >}}

**Penchan** is often used for a 1-2 or 8-9 shape within the hand, even while the entire hand has not
reached tenpai.

## Fu

Because the winning tile does not complete a shuntsu which was completable on two sides, winning
from a penchan awards 2 fu to the hand and does not count as pinfu. Sometimes, a winning tile can be
interpreted to complete either a penchan or something else, and the higher-scoring interpretation
will be used.

{{< t 22m12345p345678s >}}, winning tiles: {{< t 3p >}} or {{< t 6p >}}

This hand qualifies for pinfu on both winning tiles. If a 3-pin is used, it is interpreted as
completing the ryanmen 4-5 with the shuntsu 1-2-3 already in place. If it were interpreted as a 1-2
penchan winning with 3-pin and 4-5-6 already in place, the hand would gain 2 fu, but lose 1 han for
not scoring pinfu.

{{< t 22m12345p111s678s >}}, tsumo: {{< t 3p >}}

This hand, however, will interpret the 3-pin to complete the penchan 1-2 instead of the ryanmen 4-5.
It doesn't qualify for pinfu anyway because of the 1-sou ankou. This interpretation makes the hand
worth 40 fu instead of 30: It has 20 base fu, 8 fu from the ankou, 2 fu for winning by tsumo, 2 fu
for the penchan machi, making 32 fu in all, rounded to 40.

## Strategy

Penchans are generally considered to be a bad shape, or unfavorable pattern. The limit stems from
the need of only one tile type for completion. This limitation renders the pattern difficult for
tile development. For a 1-2 penchan, the 4 of the same suit is a useful tile, on which the 1 may be
discarded. A 2-4 shape can be completed with only one tile still, but it can be turned into the
ryanmen 4-5 by drawing the 5 and discarding the 2, if necessary. In short, penchan offers a limited
ability to alter the wait pattern, if a need arises, especially for a case of karaten, when all four
tile types are not available.

### Best uses

`Main|Suji`

The pattern is generally weak in terms of the number of tiles needed for completion. However, the
pattern may be strengthened with the use of suji. A discarded 6 tile may signal the 3 tile as safe
for the other players. In the case of waiting for a 7 tile, then the 4 would be discared. For either
case, players may utilize penchan to "suji bait" other players into discarding seemingly safe tiles,
when in fact they're the winning tiles.

Both chanta and junchan may particularly, but not necessarily, be using penchan waits. Both these
yaku rely on tiles near the ends (1,2,3) and (7,8,9). Not always but often enough, they end up using
penchan waits during development and at tenpai.
