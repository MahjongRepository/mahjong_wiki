**Ryantan** {{< kana "リャンタン" >}} and **pentan** {{< kana "ペンタン" >}} are combination waits,
which involve a triplet and an adjacently appended numbered tile. The tile combinations for both
appear identical. However, pentan involves [terminals]({{< ref "/riichi/yakuman/chinroutou.md" >}}),
where as ryantan does not.

Pentan is a combination of [penchan]({{< ref "/riichi/terminology/waits/penchan.md" >}}) and tanki.
This can occur in two ways, but both involve terminals and tiles 2 or 8. When the triplet is
composed of terminals, then the appended tile is either 2 or 8. When the triplet is composed of
either 2 or 8 tiles, then the appended tile is either 1 or 9.

Ryantan is a combination of [ryanmen]({{< ref "/riichi/terminology/waits/ryanmen.md" >}}) and
[tanki]({{< ref "/riichi/terminology/waits/tanki.md" >}}). The tile composition is a converse to
pentan. It involves triplets and appended tile of the other numbers: 2 through 8. The terminals are
excluded for this combination.
