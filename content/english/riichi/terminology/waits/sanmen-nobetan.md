**Sanmentan** is an extension to nobetan, which utilizes multiple tanki (pair waits). While nobetan
uses two, sanmentan uses three. Sanmentan is recognizable as a pattern of seven consecutive tiles.
Always, the wait pattern utilizes a whole suji triple, like 2-5-8.

## Tile pattern

- {{< t 2345678p000000z >}} Agari: {{< t 2p >}}, {{< t 5p >}}, or {{< t 8p >}}

## Fu

`main|Fu`

Since the pattern seeks to complete the pair, this pattern is awarded 2 fu. It counts for the pair
wait, despite multiple instances of it.

## Development

This waiting pattern is always a string of 7 numbered tiles. Within this string of 7 tiles, two
sequential tile groups can be formed, which may be shifted depending on the paired tile. To
determine the tile wait with this pattern, especially when a hybrid complex pattern is involved, the
player needs to identify which tile will be the paired tile in the hand.
