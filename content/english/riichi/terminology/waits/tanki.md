**Tanki** {{< kana "単騎" >}} is a common type of wait pattern. Most mahjong hands form to complete
the fourth meld. However, a handful of mahjong hands can be formed with four complete melds, while
needing to finish the pair. That makes this pattern referred to as the "pair wait". Unlike the other
basic patterns, there are a few types of pair waits to consider.

## Pattern

{{< t 000000000000z4p >}}

The wait pattern involves waiting for a single tile.

### Hadaka tanki

{{< t 4p >}} {{< t -000-000-000-000z >}}

**Hadaka tanki** {{< kana "裸単騎" >}} is a special type of pair wait pattern. A hand in this state
has called for discarded tiles four times. Upon doing so, only one tile is left closed in the hand.
The yakuman suukantsu always ends up as hadaka tanki at tenpai.

Of all the hand possibilities, hadaka tanki is the weakest position in terms of defending. Only one
tile can be exchanged by the draw-discard process. This is due to the static nature of tiles in open
calls. The worst case scenario for a hand in hadaka tanki involves both the waiting tile and the
drawn tile as winning tiles for another player. In this case, a player has no choice but to play
into another player's hand.

### Jigoku

`main|Jigoku` **Jigoku** {{< kana "地獄" >}} is a specific tanki wait, where two tiles are rendered
unavailable within the discards and/or the dora indicator.

### Nakabukure

{{< t 000z3445s000000z >}}

**Nakabukure** {{< kana "中膨れ" >}} is a type of pair wait. Here, the middle tile is duplicated in
a sequence. So, the waiting tile is that single duplicated tile. With two of the tiles of that type
in hand, this gives the wait one less tile to wait for compared to a regular tanki. An alternate
term, **harabote** {{< kana "腹ボテ" >}}, may be used, but it is also an inappropriate term.

## Chiitoitsu

`main|Chiitoitsu`

Every chiitoitsu tenpai hand uses tanki, as the pattern looks to match up the last pair for
completion.

## Usage

![Tile discarded [appearing to be safe](http://tenhou.net/0/?log=2015010702gm-0089-0000-9548571b&tw=1&ts=4), when two already discarded.](Deceptive.png "Tile discarded appearing to be safe, when two already discarded.")
Tanki, or single tile, is best used when seeking to win off of a player's discard. While the number
of waiting tiles is limited to a maximum of three, the pattern has its uses. It's greatest strength
stems from its ability to select any tile as a waiting tile, barring any tile limitations applied by
certain yaku. Often enough, this pattern may confuse players; and even traps, like suji traps, may
be employed. Not even kabe may be applicable. Waits involving honor tiles, especially when one is
discarded, is actually powerful, because players may believe those tiles are actually safe tiles.
All-in-all, this pattern is best used to counter or bait players, who are looking to defend.
