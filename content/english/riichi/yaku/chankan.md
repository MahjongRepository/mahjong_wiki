**Chankan** {{< kana "搶槓" >}} is a standard yaku. It is dependent on the usage of
[kan]({{< ref "/riichi/rules/kan.md" >}}), where a player may declare ron while a player calls to
upgrade a [minkou]({{< ref "/riichi/terminology/mentsu.md" >}}) (triple called via
[pon]({{< ref "/riichi/rules/naki.md" >}})) to a shominkan (added kan). In other words, if a player
is tenpai for a tile used for that specific added kan, then the player may declare a win on that
tile.

In almost all cases, players are not allowed to call ron on an
[ankan]({{< ref "/riichi/rules/kan.md" >}}) (closed kan). The notable exception involves a
[kokushi]({{< ref "/riichi/terminology/waits/kokushi-musou.md" >}})
[tenpai]({{< ref "/riichi/strategy/tenpai.md" >}}) hand, where the last tile needed for the yakuman
is called for an ankan. However, the kokushi exception varies on the rules. In some rules, it is
disallowed outright.

## Hand pattern

250px|thumb|[Chankan example

Alternatively, this yaku may be referred to as "robbing a kan".
[Tenpai]({{< ref "/riichi/strategy/tenpai.md" >}}) for chankan must involve a hand, in which one of
the [waiting tiles]({{< ref "/riichi/strategy/machi.md" >}}) has been called as
[pon]({{< ref "/riichi/rules/naki.md" >}}) by another player. Any tenpai hand works for chankan,
even "yakuless" hands. As long as the waiting tile has been called for
[pon]({{< ref "/riichi/rules/naki.md" >}}) earlier and then the player calls for an added kan, this
creates a time for a player to claim the added tile for a win. Naturally, waits involving [honor
tiles]({{< ref "/riichi/terminology/jihai.md" >}}) do not work in this situation.

While the call for kan reveals additional [dora]({{< ref "/riichi/rules/dora.md" >}}), in the form
of kan-dora, the call for chankan interrupts the process for kan. Therefore, additional dora is not
revealed.

### Limitation

If a player is tenpai for [suukantsu]({{< ref "/riichi/yakuman/suukantsu.md" >}}) and a fifth kan is
invoked, chankan may not be applied if that fifth kan is an added kan.

## Machi

`main|Machi`

As defined, chankan can only be achieved when a
[minkou]({{< ref "/riichi/terminology/mentsu.md" >}}) (open triplet) is upgraded to a _shouminkan_.
In other words, a player had called pon earlier and then drew the 4th tile, for the kan. If another
player is tenpai for that tile, then the player may declare ron. To some degree, the added kan may
be viewed as a discard in this case.

So, when it comes to [machi]({{< ref "/riichi/strategy/machi.md" >}}) (wait patterns), only three
basic types can be used for chankan: [penchan]({{< ref "/riichi/terminology/waits/penchan.md" >}}),
[kanchan]({{< ref "/riichi/terminology/waits/kanchan.md" >}}), and
[ryanmen]({{< ref "/riichi/terminology/waits/ryanmen.md" >}}). Some patterns that utilize any of
these three may also apply. This is simply due to the number of tiles remaining (just one), for
every minkou. So, tile patterns involving
[shanpon]({{< ref "/riichi/terminology/waits/shanpon.md" >}}) and
[tanki]({{< ref "/riichi/terminology/waits/tanki.md" >}}) are impossible for chankan, as they each
possess tiles necessary for kan calls.

In the case for [kokushi musou]({{< ref "/riichi/terminology/waits/kokushi-musou.md" >}}), the hand
is tenpai for kokushi with one of the 13-tile types already paired; and it is waiting for the last
tile type for completion. An exception to kan calls involving
[ankan]({{< ref "/riichi/rules/kan.md" >}}) (closed kan) is made.

### Furiten

Under any possible instance of chankan, one player is barred from calling ron and awarded this yaku
due to [furiten]({{< ref "/riichi/strategy/furiten.md" >}}). The initial tile discard was granted
for the open call for pon.

## Compatability

`main|Yaku compatability`

`Yaku compatibility table|CHK`

Essentially, chankan combines yaku, that utilizes the [tile
waits]({{< ref "/riichi/strategy/machi.md" >}}) of either
[ryanmen]({{< ref "/riichi/terminology/waits/ryanmen.md" >}}) or
[kanchan]({{< ref "/riichi/terminology/waits/kanchan.md" >}}). Either of these two tile waits do not
include the waiting tile in the hand. That excludes
[toitoi]({{< ref "/riichi/yaku/toitoihou.md" >}}),
[chiitoitsu]({{< ref "/riichi/yaku/chiitoitsu.md" >}}), and
[honroutou]({{< ref "/riichi/yaku/honroutou.md" >}}). These three require the tile waits of either
[shanpon]({{< ref "/riichi/terminology/waits/shanpon.md" >}}) or
[tanki]({{< ref "/riichi/terminology/waits/tanki.md" >}}); and so, the fourth tile to invoke kan is
used in another player's hand. As for [ryanpeikou]({{< ref "/riichi/yaku/ryanpeikou.md" >}}), this
hand may use ryanmen for completion. However, the tile requirement for ryanpeikou is already in the
hand. Otherwise, chankan invoked with a ryanpeikou tenpai hand would only count for
[iipeikou]({{< ref "/riichi/yaku/iipeikou.md" >}}).

As for [rinshan]({{< ref "/riichi/yaku/rinshan-kaihou.md" >}}),
[haitei]({{< ref "/riichi/yaku/haitei-raoyue-and-houtei-raoyui.md" >}}),
[houtei]({{< ref "/riichi/yaku/haitei-raoyue-and-houtei-raoyui.md" >}}), and
[mentsumo]({{< ref "/riichi/yaku/menzenchin-tsumohou.md" >}}), it is physicially impossible to
combine any of these four with chankan. In the case for rinshan, the possibility to combine with
chankan is outright impossible, as rinshan is defined by winning from the dead wall tile draw. In
the case of haitei and houtei, a player cannot call kan, when the dead wall cannot be maintained at
14-tiles. This case occurs, at the last allowable tile draw of the hand.

### Ippatsu

The [ippatsu]({{< ref "/riichi/yaku/optional/ippatsu.md" >}}) yaku is normally interrupted by a kan
call. To call chankan, the opposing player had already called for kan. However, ippatsu is still not
interrupted because the whole kan process has not been completed. The entire kan process includes
the kan call itself, plus the rinshan draw and the discard afterwards. The chankan win occurs in the
middle of that process. So, it is allowable to score both ippatsu and chankan at the same time.

## Special cases

![Case where a [closed kan]({{< ref "/riichi/rules/kan.md" >}}) was declared during a [kokushi tenpai](http://tenhou.net/0/?log=2018041311gm-000b-7447-e286a4e6&tw=2&ts=6).](Kokushi_deny.png "Case where a closed kan was declared during a kokushi tenpai.")

### Rinshan kaihou

Given the procedure for kan, the chankan takes precedence over [rinshan
kaihou]({{< ref "/riichi/yaku/rinshan-kaihou.md" >}}). Here, the call for a chankan win denies even
the drawing of the rinshan tile. Therefore, even the chance for rinshan kaihou is denied.

### Kokushi musou

If the rules allow, a special case for [kokushi
musou]({{< ref "/riichi/terminology/waits/kokushi-musou.md" >}}) exists. This involves a kokushi
tenpai hand, where the final tile may be completed with an opponent calling
[kan]({{< ref "/riichi/rules/kan.md" >}}) with a closed kan using all four of that particular
winning tile. Thus, ron may be declared in that instance, involing the special chankan rule. This is
the only case where a tile may be taken from an closed kan. However, this particular rule may be
subject to variation, which may or may not allow the play to occur.
