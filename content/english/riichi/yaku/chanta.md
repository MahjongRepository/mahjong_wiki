**Chanta** {{< kana "全帯" >}} is the common name to **honchantaiyaochuu**
{{< kana "混全帯么九" >}}. It is a terminal and honor based yaku. For this yaku, every tile group
and the pair must contain at least one terminal or honor tile. The hand must contain at least one
honor and one non-terminal tile, otherwise the hand will score junchan, honroutou, or chinroutou
instead. Occasionally, it can be referred to as **chantaiyao** {{< kana "全帯么" >}} or
**chantaiyaochuu** {{< kana "全帯么九" >}}.

## Tile pattern

{{< t 123p999s44z23789m >}} Waiting for: {{< t 1m >}}

_Note_: This hand is also waiting for {{< t 4m >}}, but it would not be chanta.

## Formation

By definition, every tile group must include a terminal or honor tile. So combinations of tile
groups involving 1-2-3, 7-8-9, 1-1-1, 9-9-9, and/or any honor pairs/triplet applies here. This
brings about the limitations of the terminal tiles, by which they're at the ends of the 1-9 number
scale. Often, this yaku is particularly made easier with tile calls; but closed hands are very much
doable.

### Compatability

`main|Yaku compatability`

`Yaku compatibility table|CHA`

Chanta's pattern is similar to junchan; however, the two can never combine as junchan implies a
chanta hand. Honroutou likewise implies chanta and is thus incompatible. Chanta with toitoi or
chiitoitsu actually forms honroutou instead of chanta, while chanta with chinitsu is actually
junchan instead of chanta.

Chanta is incompatible with tanyao and ittsu because both of those require a group which is not a
terminal or honour---in tanyao's case, it is required of all tiles in the hand, and for ittsu, a
4-5-6 sequence is needed.
