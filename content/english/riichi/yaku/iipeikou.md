**Iipeikou** {{< kana "一盃口" >}} is a standard [yaku]({{< ref "/riichi/yaku/yaku.md" >}})
involving two identical sequences. Identical means that both
[shuntsu]({{< ref "/riichi/terminology/mentsu.md" >}}) must be of the same numbers and suit. This
yaku also requires the hand to be closed. A single [open call]({{< ref "/riichi/rules/naki.md" >}})
invalidates the yaku, even if the pattern exists within the hand. If this pattern is found twice in
one hand, an alternative yaku, [ryanpeikou]({{< ref "/riichi/yaku/ryanpeikou.md" >}}), is scored.

## Tile pattern

{{< t 334455m00000000z >}}

### Rearrangement

{{< t 345345m00000000z >}}

Arrangement of tiles is irrelevant, as long as two groups of tiles form the identical sequences.

## Formation

This yaku is usually presented as three groups of consecutive pairs. However, the rule
interpretation views them as a two sequences. Potential acquisition of this yaku is best
recognizable when five out of the six tiles are present in the hand.

### Compatability

`Yaku compatibility table|IPK`

Iipeikou requires two sequences, and as a result is incompatible with [sanshoku
doukou]({{< ref "/riichi/yaku/sanshoku-doukou.md" >}}),
[toitoi]({{< ref "/riichi/yaku/toitoihou.md" >}}),
[honroutou]({{< ref "/riichi/yaku/honroutou.md" >}}),
[chiitoitsu]({{< ref "/riichi/yaku/chiitoitsu.md" >}}),
[sanankou]({{< ref "/riichi/yaku/sanankou.md" >}}), and
[sankantsu]({{< ref "/riichi/yaku/sankantsu.md" >}}), all of which require either at least three
[koutsu]({{< ref "/riichi/terminology/mentsu.md" >}})/[kantsu]({{< ref "/riichi/terminology/mentsu.md" >}})
or a seven pair structure. The final incompatibility is with
[ryanpeikou]({{< ref "/riichi/yaku/ryanpeikou.md" >}}), as ryanpeikou implies iipeikou and so
iipeikou is not counted.
