**Iipeikou** {{< kana "一盃口" >}} is a standard yaku involving two identical sequences. Identical
means that both shuntsu must be of the same numbers and suit. This yaku also requires the hand to be
closed. A single open call invalidates the yaku, even if the pattern exists within the hand. If this
pattern is found twice in one hand, an alternative yaku, ryanpeikou, is scored.

## Tile pattern

{{< t 334455m00000000z >}}

### Rearrangement

{{< t 345345m00000000z >}}

Arrangement of tiles is irrelevant, as long as two groups of tiles form the identical sequences.

## Formation

This yaku is usually presented as three groups of consecutive pairs. However, the rule
interpretation views them as a two sequences. Potential acquisition of this yaku is best
recognizable when five out of the six tiles are present in the hand.

### Compatability

`main|Yaku compatability`

`Yaku compatibility table|IPK`

Iipeikou requires two sequences, and as a result is incompatible with sanshoku doukou, toitoi,
honroutou, chiitoitsu, sanankou, and sankantsu, all of which require either at least three
koutsu/kantsu or a seven pair structure. The final incompatibility is with ryanpeikou, as ryanpeikou
implies iipeikou and so iipeikou is not counted.
