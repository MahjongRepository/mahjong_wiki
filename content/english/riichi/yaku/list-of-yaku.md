![[Example hand](http://tenhou.net/0/?log=2008121721gm-00c1-0000-fcadb0d7&tw=3&ts=5), containing many yaku.](YakuListed.png "Example hand, containing many yaku.")
A **yaku** {{< kana "役" >}} is a certain pattern in a mahjong hand, or a special condition under
which a win is declared. Many yaku are pattern-based yaku comparable to "poker hands". Unlike poker,
yaku types do not supercede each other. Instead, they are the main factor to determine hand values.
Players must finish hands before others do; and each yaku has specific values attached to them to
determine payment amounts.

The yaku and their values are essential for scoring. The game rules define lots of different yaku,
worth a different amount of **han** {{< kana "飜" >}} based on their difficulty or pre-assigned
value. A player can incorporate several different yaku in the same hand and accumulate their han
values for high-scoring hands. For additional scoring, the game also features dora. However,
possession of dora are not considered as yaku, even though they provide han.

**In order to win any hand in this game, a player requires at least one yaku.** A hand having no
yaku may not win, even if it has multiple dora. Declaring a win on a yakuless hand may result in
chombo. So, as an early part of the game's learning process, it is essential to learn the different
yaku listed here and eventually their han values.

The most important yaku to learn is riichi, since it is very common and a very easy yaku to achieve.
A new player may find it easiest to avoid opening their hand and simply aim for riichi every time;
no other yaku is required to win the hand. However, this strategy is far too simple for serious play
and an experienced player should generally aim for a high-scoring yaku or combination of yaku from
the beginning of the hand.

## Optional

`main|Optional yaku`

The above list is generally considered as the "standard yaku", including the yakuman. However, the
game offers an even larger array of tile patterns. Various house rules may opt to use some of these
yaku on their own.
