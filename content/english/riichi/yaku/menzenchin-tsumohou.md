**Menzenchin tsumohou** {{< kana "門前清自摸和" >}}, otherwise referred as **menzen tsumo** or even
simpler **tsumo** {{< kana "ツモ" >}}, is a yaku involving closed hands. Literally, a player with a
closed tenpai hand may win with tsumo, as this is a yaku all on its own.

## Formation

With this yaku, all closed hands qualify for menzen tsumo, even if it is the only yaku. No open hand
may qualify for this yaku. The instant a player calls on a discarded tile, then the player forfeits
the right to claim this yaku until the next hand, just like riichi.

## Riichi vs damaten

`main|Riichi|Damaten`

While in tenpai with a closed, riichi is not a required move for any player. Instead, the player
opts to utilize the tactic of damaten. In some cases, the winning tile is drawn and the hand may
win.

## Compatibility

Mentsumo with toitoi is actually the yakuman, suuankou. Otherwise, this yaku is compatible with all
yaku except for houtei and chankan. Neither of those two yaku can win by self-draw.

### With riichi

This yaku is typically accompanied with riichi. Of course, the use of riichi is only advisable on
the current state of the game: current point standing, other player riichi calls, potentially
threatening hands, tile waits, and tile availability. At times, it may simply be advisable to
utilize damaten, rather than putting one self at risk.
