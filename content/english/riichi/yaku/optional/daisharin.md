**Daisharin** {{< kana "大車輪" >}} is one of three yakuman awarded for a closed hand with the
following pattern: **22334455667788**. The name daisharin applies to the pinzu. Using the exact same
number pattern, **daichikurin** {{< kana "大竹林" >}} and **daisuurin** {{< kana "大数隣" >}} apply
to souzu and manzu respectively. Despite the difficulty of attaining this pattern, they are classed
as optional.

Despite the fact that they are technically three different yaku, they are often referred to
collectively as daisharin: a ruleset which uses daisharin usually implicitly also uses the other
two, and occasionally a daichikurin or daisuurin hand will be incorrectly referred to as daisharin.

## Pattern

The pattern for daisharin differs only in which tile is used to win the hand, and will always have
at least one yasume tile:

{{< t 2233445667788p >}} Agari: {{< t 5p >}} Yasume: {{< t 28p >}}

The same applies to daichikurin:

{{< t 2334455667788s >}} Agari: {{< t 2s >}} Yasume: {{< t 58s >}}

and daisuurin:

{{< t 2233445567788m >}} Agari: {{< t 6m >}} Yasume: {{< t 9m >}}

## Scoring

When classified as distinct yaku, daisharin and company are awarded yakuman. Even if they are not
used, however, than hands are worth at least a sanbaiman:

- Pinfu: 1 han
- Tanyao: 1 han
- Ryanpeikou: 3 han
- Chinitsu: 6 han

The high score that this hand naturally achieves helps to explain why it is uncommonly scored as
yakuman.
