**Ippatsu** {{< kana "一発" >}} is a yaku completely dependent on
[riichi]({{< ref "/riichi/rules/riichi.md" >}}). By definition, ippatsu requires a riichi
declaration to be in effect, for an additional 1 han. Therefore, ippatsu cannot function as a
stand-alone yaku.

It is awarded if the player receives a winning tile within an uninterrupted set of opponent tile
draws after the riichi declaration. The earliest possible chance to win with ippatsu comes from the
shimocha's discard (player to the right). The latest possible chance to win with ippatsu is with the
player's next drawn tile after the riichi declaration.

[Tile calls]({{< ref "/riichi/rules/naki.md" >}}) may immediately end the chance for ippatsu any
time before the riichi declarer draws the next tile. This includes any calls for
[kan]({{< ref "/riichi/rules/kan.md" >}}), except for a robbed kan
([chankan]({{< ref "/riichi/yaku/chankan.md" >}})). Once again, in order to award ippatsu, the cycle
between a player's riichi discard and next turn to discard must be uninterrupted. Even if the hand
wins before the next tile draw, ippatsu does not count of a tile call was made previously. Thus,
players may actually use the option to make tile calls to deliberately deny a player that chance for
ippatsu.

While ippatsu is generally considered to be a standard yaku, certain
[rulesets]({{< ref "/riichi/rules/variations/rule-variations.md" >}}) do not use it, in order to
reduce variance and lower the value of a riichii. In general, when sitting down to play a game,
ippatsu is counted unless otherwise specified or agreed on before the game.

## Examples

- [Ippatsu](http://tenhou.net/0/?log=2013061615gm-0089-0000-x380955c19e8f&tw=0&ts=3) after
  [kan]({{< ref "/riichi/rules/kan.md" >}}).

<!-- end list -->

-

    Kan is called prior to the riichi call; and the hand wins on the next draw without interruption. Therefore, ippatsu is valid.

<!-- end list -->

- [Ippatsu on discard](http://tenhou.net/0/?log=2014081719gm-0009-7447-73936980&tw=1)

<!-- end list -->

-

    This hand wins on a discard before the next draw.

### Ippatsu nullified

- Ippatsu blocked

In this example, the hand wins from an opponent discard before the next tile draw. However, two tile
calls were made prior to the win. So, ippatsu is invalid here.

## Compatability

`main|Yaku compatability` `Yaku compatibility table|IPP` Ippatsu is unique among the yaku, for it
requires riichi to even be applicable. Because of this, it is impossible for a hand to score with
ippatsu alone. Ippatsu _can_ combine with [chankan]({{< ref "/riichi/yaku/chankan.md" >}}), as the
kan call is not considered complete if someone wins off it.

At the very minimum, a hand could be riichi with ippatsu. Unlike riichi, ippatsu is not compatible
with every other yaku. Two cannot mix with ippatsu: [rinshan
kaihou]({{< ref "/riichi/yaku/rinshan-kaihou.md" >}}) and [houtei
raoyui]({{< ref "/riichi/yaku/haitei-raoyue-and-houtei-raoyui.md" >}}).

Regarding rinshan kaihou, the required call for [kan]({{< ref "/riichi/rules/kan.md" >}}) to invoke
rinshan already cancels out ippatsu. With one single tile left in the regular wall, the last chance
to call kan is allowable. This may imply the rinshan draw as the "last possible tile draw". However,
that tile came from the dead wall as opposed to the regular wall, which is not the definition for
the haitei.

As for houtei, a riichi declaration must be made with at least 4 tiles left in the live wall. That
leaves the very last possible tile draw (and discard) belonging to the riichi declarer.

### With haitei

!Last chance to call riichi, with possible
[Ippatsu.](Last_chance_riichi.png "Last chance to call riichi, with possible Ippatsu and haitei.")

The last possible chance for riichi comes, when there are eighteen tiles left in the walls. This
counts the dead wall after a tile draw. So, that leaves four tiles left for regular player draws;
and barring any tile calling, every player would then have only one tile draw left. For haitei then,
the fourth remaining and last tile tile draw goes to the riichi caller. Naturally, tile calls may
occur beforehand to deny both the ippatsu and haitei chance.
