**Renhou** {{< kana "人和" >}} is an optional yaku. It is defined by a player declaring ron with a
starting hand before the dealer gets a second turn or before any called tile. This premise is
similar to the chiihou, except the hand wins by discard (ron). In some instances, it may be
considered as a yakuman, mangan, or not used at all. Only non-dealers may invoke renhou, as the
first discard always comes from the dealer (except when the dealer wins by tenhou).

## Variations

![Renhou scored with real tiles.](Renhou_senechal_20150719_185614.jpg "Renhou scored with real tiles.")

Because of number of variations and interpretations to renhou, it is viewed as optional.

- **Mangan**

<!-- end list -->

-


    By default, renhou can be defaulted as a mangan hand. In this case, if the hand could score more using normal counting of yaku and dora, it will be scored for the alternate value (since the highest-scoring hand must always be chosen). The hand must have at least one yaku for this, however; dora alone cannot allow the hand to be scored separately.

<!-- end list -->

- **Yakuman**

<!-- end list -->

-


    Likewise, it can be set as a yakuman.

<!-- end list -->

- **Baiman**

<!-- end list -->

-


    A few rulesets set renhou as a baiman, though this is relatively rare.

<!-- end list -->

- **Yaku**

<!-- end list -->

-


    Renhou may be considered as a yaku, to be cumulative with other yaku, with a variable han value. It is frequently set at 4 han, so that the hand is always worth mangan minimum if it has any other yaku.

<!-- end list -->

- **Nashi**

<!-- end list -->

-


    Renhou may not be used at all.
