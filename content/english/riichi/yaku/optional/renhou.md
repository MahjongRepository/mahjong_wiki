**Renhou** {{< kana "人和" >}} is an [optional
yaku]({{< ref "/riichi/yaku/optional/local-yaku.md" >}}). It is defined by a player declaring
[ron]({{< ref "/riichi/rules/naki.md" >}}) with a starting hand before the dealer gets a second turn
or before any [ called tile]({{< ref "/riichi/rules/naki.md" >}}). This premise is similar to the
[chiihou]({{< ref "/riichi/yakuman/tenhou-and-chiihou.md" >}}), except the hand wins by discard
(ron). In some instances, it may be considered as a
[yakuman]({{< ref "/riichi/yakuman/yakuman.md" >}}),
[mangan]({{< ref "/riichi/strategy/scoring-table.md" >}}), or not used at all. Only non-dealers may
invoke renhou, as the first discard always comes from the dealer (except when the dealer wins by
[tenhou]({{< ref "/riichi/online/tenhou/tenhou.md" >}})).

## Variations

![Renhou scored with real tiles.](Renhou_senechal_20150719_185614.jpg "Renhou scored with real tiles.")

Because of number of variations and interpretations to renhou, it is viewed as optional.

- **[Mangan]({{< ref "/riichi/strategy/scoring-table.md" >}})**

<!-- end list -->

-

    By default, renhou can be defaulted as a mangan hand. In this case, if the hand could score more using normal counting of yaku and dora, it will be scored for the alternate value (since the highest-scoring hand must always be chosen). The hand must have at least one yaku for this, however; dora alone cannot allow the hand to be scored separately.

<!-- end list -->

- **[Yakuman]({{< ref "/riichi/yakuman/yakuman.md" >}})**

<!-- end list -->

-

    Likewise, it can be set as a yakuman.

<!-- end list -->

- **[Baiman]({{< ref "/riichi/strategy/scoring-table.md" >}})**

<!-- end list -->

-

    A few rulesets set renhou as a baiman, though this is relatively rare.

<!-- end list -->

- **[Yaku]({{< ref "/riichi/yaku/yaku.md" >}})**

<!-- end list -->

-

    Renhou may be considered as a yaku, to be [cumulative with other yaku]({{< ref "/riichi/strategy/yaku-compatibility.md" >}}), with a variable han value. It is frequently set at 4 han, so that the hand is always worth mangan minimum if it has any other yaku.

<!-- end list -->

- **Nashi**

<!-- end list -->

-

    Renhou may not be used at all.
