  - Pinfu

```

**Pinfu** {{< kana "平和" >}} is a standard yaku. This yaku is defined by having 0 fu aside from the
base 20 fu, or 30 fu in the case of a closed ron. It is worth 1 han and closed only. Under all
cases, a tenpai for pinfu requires the wait pattern of ryanmen (open wait).

## Tile diagram

{{< t 123m23478s56799p >}} Winning tile: {{< t 6s >}} or {{< t 9s >}}

The winning tile completes the last sequence, which is worth 0 fu, making the hand pinfu.

## English reference

`main|Fu`

In English, pinfu is sometimes referred to as "all sequences". However, the yaku is not as simple as
that. Other than having an open hand, it is possible for a hand to be composed of all sequences and
still not be classed as a pinfu.

### Counter examples

The following examples are all "all sequence hands"; but they are not pinfu.

## Fu

`main|Fu`

To understand pinfu, players must understand the nature of **fu**, or mini-points. Fu are a set of
points associated with hand composition. In the case of pinfu, the relevant sources of fu comes from
the tile groups and the wait patterns. The only wait pinfu gains fu involves the 10 fu gained from
winning with a closed ron.

Therefore, pinfu must avoid these patterns:

- Any koutsu or kantsu is worth at least 2 fu. A pinfu hand must have four shuntsu.
- Winning from a tanki, kanchan, or penchan wait is worth 2 fu.
- A pair of yakuhai, i.e., dragons, the round wind, or the seat wind, is worth 2 fu. A pinfu hand
  must have a valueless pair.
- An open hand worth 20 fu is counted as 30 fu. Pinfu may only be awarded to a closed hand.

In the end, a pinfu hand must win from a ryanmen or ryanmenten wait. In other words, the winning
tile must complete an open shuntsu (sequence).

As an exception, pinfu with mentsumo gains 0 fu from tsumo, or winning by self-draw. Normally, a
winning tile drawn from the wall is worth 2 fu. In turn, the hand qualifies as pinfu, and these 2 fu
are waived. The hand is then scored at 20 fu; and at least 2 han for menzen tsumo and pinfu. Some
rule variations may not allow waiving these fu, and score such a hand as 30 fu, tsumo, without
pinfu. Such variations are rare.

## Compatibility

`main|Yaku compatibility`

`Yaku compatibility table|PFU`

Essentially, pinfu is incompatible with any yaku that employs triplets, including rinshan. It is
similarly incompatible with chiitoitsu, which does not use mentsu at all. On the other hand, pinfu
works any sequential based yaku. As long as the hand is closed, the pair does not produce "fu", and
the wait is open, then pinfu may be applied.
