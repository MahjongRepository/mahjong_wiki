Completed the nagashi mangan with a spare haku.

| comment = Fairly natural hand development towards [tanyao]({{< ref "/riichi/yaku/tanyao.md" >}}). A riichi turn 8 switched the player to defensive, where repeated draws of safe tiles carried the nagashi. Had a spare nan at the end.

Luckily, [Kamicha]({{< ref "/riichi/strategy/jikaze.md" >}}) riichi'd and the player drew a 9pin for the [haiteihai]({{< ref "/riichi/yaku/haitei-raoyue-and-houtei-raoyui.md" >}}) to complete the mangan and barely overtake third.
