| comment = [Ankan]({{< ref "/riichi/rules/kan.md" >}}) is called at the last possible moment to draw the winning tile and win the game with [gyakuten]({{< ref "/riichi/terminology/gyakuten.md" >}}). This opportunity was made possible by kamicha's [pon]({{< ref "/riichi/rules/naki.md" >}}) immediately beforehand, which was perhaps called to prevent toimen from getting a final draw and thus possibly [haitei]({{< ref "/riichi/yaku/haitei-raoyue-and-houtei-raoyui.md" >}}) and gyakuten.
