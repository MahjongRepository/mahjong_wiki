| comment = A quick pon of hatsu led this player to push a honitsu which quickly turned into a viable ryuuiisou. The lack of calls and the early tenpai makes this victory rather stunning.

| comment = With 10 tiles of 14 needed, this hand pointed towards ryuu iisou early. Quick pons of hatsu and 6s lead to a 3-way hidden wait after only 6 discards, into which kamicha dealt immediately.

| comment = Tenpai for yakuhai and honitsu, but winning tile declined with intent for the yakuman. Instead, the winning tile is called for pon. After the hand goes into furiten, a furiten tile was discarded; and later, the hand escapes furiten by going to dora hadaka tanki.
