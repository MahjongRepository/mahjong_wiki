## Shousuushii

| comment = With all four winds in the hand while two are paired, it was presumed to be a reasonable hand to attempt the yakuman. After two tile calls, a call for a third was declined to make the yakuman as inconspicuous as possible.

| comment = Initial hand showed yakuman potential with three pairs of the wind tiles along with an extra Pei. After making calls on the Ton, Nan and Shaa, the fourth Shaa was drawn, a late Kan was made, and the hand was completed with the Pei via Rinshan Kaihou.
