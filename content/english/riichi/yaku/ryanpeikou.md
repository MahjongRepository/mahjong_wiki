**Ryanpeikou** {{< kana "二盃口" >}} is a standard yaku, consisting of two "iipeikou". The prefix
"ryan" is a Japanese counter for mahjong, signifying for "two".

## Tile pattern

{{< t 223344p66778m11z >}} Agari: {{< t 8m >}}

_Note:_ This hand may also win with {{< t 5m >}}. However, it'll only count for a lesser value of
pinfu and iipeikou.

## Formation

At the very least, the hand must initially qualify for the yaku, iipeikou. With tenpai, the tile
wait involves a tanki, to complete the pair, or the need to complete the other "iipeikou".

## Compatability

`main|Yaku compatability`

`Yaku compatibility table|RPK`

Ryanpeikou is incompatible with other yaku that place conflicting requirements on the mentsu in the
hand. Ittsu, sanshoku, sanshoku doukou, toitoi, sanankou, sankantsu, and shousangen are excluded as
they are require either three different sequences or at least one triplet/quadruplet. Rinshan kaihou
also requires a kan, so it is excluded. Chankan is incompatible because the winning tile must be
unique in the winning hand---all four copies of it having been used in another player's kan.
Finally, iipeikou is incompatible because it is superseded by ryanpeikou.

### Chiitoitsu

This yaku does not combine with chiitoitsu. By definition, chiitoitsu is formed by the collection of
seven distinct pairs. In most instances of ryanpeikou, the hands look like chiitoitsu hands.
However, ryanpeikou is actually composed of sequences, rather than as independent pairs. The pattern
appears as a collection of pairs, when they are actually not. Because of this interpretation, the
two yaku remain distinct and incompatible; and it is doubtful, that any house rule allows the
combination of the two yaku.

Note that not all instances of ryanpeikou look like chiitoitsu. The following, for instance, is a
valid ryanpeikou hand:

{{< t 22334444m78899p >}} Agari: {{< t 7p >}}

### With chinitsu

Some forms of ryanpeikou mixed with chinitsu and tanyao may actually form some optional yakuman,
named daisharin (pinzu), daichikurin (souzu), and daisuurin (manzu).

{{< t 2233445566778s >}} Agari: {{< t 2s >}}, {{< t 5s >}}, or {{< t 8s >}}

## Value

![Ryanpeikou with real tiles.](Coppro_ryanpeikou.jpg "Ryanpeikou with real tiles.") `main|Scoring`
Closed only, ryanpeikou is always at 3 han. So, there is no need to be concerned about a lesser
value of the hand while open, or kuisagari. The cheapest ryanpeikou hand uses either a kanchan /
penchan / tanki wait, or a ryanmen wait with valued honor as the pair. In both cases, the hand
produces a 3-han and 40-fu value by ron. By tsumo, it is 4-han and 30-fu.
