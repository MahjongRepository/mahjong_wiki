**Ryuuiisou** {{< kana "緑一色" >}} is one of the standard yakuman hands. This hand consists of any
four [tile groups]({{< ref "/riichi/terminology/mentsu.md" >}}) and a
[pair]({{< ref "/riichi/terminology/jantou.md" >}}) that consists of only 2, 3, 4, 6, 8 of souzu
and/or the green dragon tiles. Literally, this hand is composed of "all green" painted tiles. This
hand may be open or closed.

## Tile diagram

{{< t 2233446688s666z >}} Winning tile: {{< t 6s >}} or {{< t 8s >}}

### Open

{{< t 2223344488s >}} {{< t -666s >}} Winning tile: {{< t 3s >}} or {{< t 8s >}}

This example is only possible under the common ruling of optional hatsu.

## Value

This hand is a yakuman hand which automatically awards 32000 points to a non-dealer winner, or 48000
points to a dealer winner.

## Formation

This yakuman is literally all green, as all the tiles are composed of green tiles. No markings of
other color are applied to these tiles, hence its designation as all green. With this yakuman, only
six tile types are available:

- {{< t 23468s6z >}}

With the four melds and a pair pattern, at least, five out of the six tile types are needed to
complete this yakuman. It is possible to use all six tile types, when 2-3-4 were used as shuntsu.
Given six tile types to work with, it is impossible to form a
[chiitoitsu]({{< ref "/riichi/yaku/chiitoitsu.md" >}}) type pattern. This aspect alone makes
ryuuiisou a bit easier than [chinroutou]({{< ref "/riichi/yakuman/chinroutou.md" >}}), which is
limited to the same number of tile types but not able to form shuntsu.

### Furiten

![Choice or furiten.](Ryuuiisou_tenpai.png "Choice between jigoku or furiten.")
{{< t 2344466688s666z >}} Waiting for: {{< t 1s >}} - {{< t 4s >}} or {{< t 8s >}}

This hand may regularly be subject to [furiten]({{< ref "/riichi/strategy/furiten.md" >}}),
especially around the range of 1, 2, 3, 4, and 5 sou. While it is necessary to discard 1 sou and 5
sou to build this yakuman, these discarded tiles may lead to a tenpai hand with furiten. That may be
particularly true for above example.

### Variation

Some rules require hatsu (green dragon) in the hand, among them JPML A. The more common rule
includes hatsu within the hand.
