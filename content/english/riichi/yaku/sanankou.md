**Sanankou** {{< kana "三暗刻" >}} is a yaku, consisting of three concealed triplets (ankou). The
third must not be completed off of another player's discard, as this would not count as concealed.
However, if it is completed with a tsumo, then the yaku is awarded. A concealed kan is also counted
as a concealed triplet. The hand this yaku is awarded to may be open or closed, as long as it meets
the conditions. This yaku is awarded 2 han.

## Tile pattern cases

1\. Case where the yaku is guaranteed: {{< t 111333555p6s >}} {{< t -123m >}} Agari: {{< t 6s >}}

2\. Case where the hand must be won by tsumo: {{< t 1113366p666s >}} {{< t -213s >}} Tsumo:
{{< t 3p >}} or {{< t 6p >}}

3\. Case where the hand is won by discard. {{< t 777m888p33s11777z >}} Ron: {{< t 3s >}} or
{{< t 1z >}} _Note_: A tsumo results in the suuankou yakuman.

## Formation

This yaku requires three closed triplets, as it is defined as such. This leaves only one allowable
tile call. It can be any open tile group.

### Compatability

`main|Yaku compatability`

`Yaku compatibility table|SNA`

Sanankou is incompatible with any yaku requiring more than one sequence, namely pinfu, iipeikou,
ittsu, sanshoku, and ryanpeikou. It is incompatible with chiitoitsu, which requires no mentsu at
all.

A natural combination involves toitoi. With one tile call, the hand needs to win by tsumo; otherwise
by ron, only toitoi is counted. This premise is a similar case involving suuankou, which counts as
yakuman via tsumo. Otherwise, it may not.

### Suuankou tenpai

A tenpai hand with sanankou with toitoi is tenpai for suuankou. When this hand wins by discard, then
the hand is not counted as suuankou. Instead, it is the combination of sanankou and toitoi. The
fourth triplet completed by the discarded tile counts as an "open triplet", rather than a fourth
closed one.
