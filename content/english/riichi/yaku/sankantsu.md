**Sankantsu** {{< kana "三槓子" >}} is a standard [yaku]({{< ref "/riichi/yaku/yaku.md" >}}). This
yaku requires [kan]({{< ref "/riichi/rules/kan.md" >}}) to be called three times by one player. Due
to this requirement, this yaku is actually the most difficult of the regular yaku.

## Tile pattern

{{< t 345p1z >}} {{< t 4-444m0z88s0z222-2p >}} Waiting for: {{< t 1z >}}

Per the yaku's name, kan must be called three times; and as a result, the tenpai hand has at most
four tiles remaining as closed. If necessary, the hand can call as far as a single tile remaining.

## Development

Of all the standard yaku, sankantsu is the most difficult and least frequent. Its rate of occurrence
is comparable to that of some yakuman. As the name implies,
[kan]({{< ref "/riichi/rules/kan.md" >}}) must be called three times before the end of the hand. A
fourth kan converts the hand to the yakuman,
[suukantsu]({{< ref "/riichi/yakuman/suukantsu.md" >}}). The difficulty stems from the need to call
kan three times; but overall, the use of kan is risky play due to additional
[kan-dora]({{< ref "/riichi/rules/dora.md" >}}), which may benefit the other players. This is true
even for a single kan call, let alone three times.

### Viability

Sankantsu's difficulty stems from its various pitfalls during hand development. For starters,
attaining the tiles necessary to call kan three times is difficult onto itself. In order to call kan
in the first place, a player has to draw three out of the four tiles.

### Compatability

`main|Yaku compatability`

`Yaku compatibility table|SNK`

No sequential based yaku can combine with sankantsu. Three out of the four possible tile groups must
be called for kan, and they can be referred as "triplets plus one extra". This rules out
[pinfu]({{< ref "/riichi/yaku/pinfu.md" >}}), [iipeikou]({{< ref "/riichi/yaku/iipeikou.md" >}}),
[ryanpeikou]({{< ref "/riichi/yaku/ryanpeikou.md" >}}),
[ittsu]({{< ref "/riichi/yaku/ikkitsuukan.md" >}}), and [sanshoku
doujun]({{< ref "/riichi/yaku/sanshoku-doujun.md" >}}).
[Chiitoitsu]({{< ref "/riichi/yaku/chiitoitsu.md" >}}) is incompatible due to its usage of
[pairs]({{< ref "/riichi/terminology/toitsu.md" >}}). Every other yaku is compatible.

## Value

This yaku is set at 2 [han]({{< ref "/riichi/strategy/japanese-mahjong-scoring-rules.md" >}}).
However, the number of kans significantly increases the hand's value. Even with the minimum 3 open
kan of [simples]({{< ref "/riichi/yaku/tanyao.md" >}}), they generate a [fu
count]({{< ref "/riichi/yaku/fu.md" >}}) of 8 fu each, for a total of 24 additional fu to the
base 20. So, at a minimum, this yaku is valued at [2 han and 50
fu]({{< ref "/riichi/strategy/scoring-table.md" >}}), which is the equivalent of [3 han and 25
fu]({{< ref "/riichi/strategy/scoring-table.md" >}}).

Even with a base of 2 han, the number of kan calls adds the probability of additional dora, which
may have an immediate impact on the hand value. Just one dora and adequate fu may bump the hand
already into mangan. If any of the tiles used for kan became dora, that's instantly 4 dora.
