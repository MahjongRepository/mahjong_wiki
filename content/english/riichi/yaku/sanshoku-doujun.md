  - Closed sanshoku

```

**Sanshoku doujun** {{< kana "三色同順" >}} is a standard yaku. It can also be referred as
**sanshiki** {{< kana "さんしき" >}}. This yaku involves sequences of the same numbered tiles across
the three numbered suits. The short hand **sanshoku** more commonly refers to this yaku, rather than
the significantly more difficult to achieve sanshoku doukou yaku. This yaku simply happens more
frequently.

## Tile pattern

{{< t 123m123p123678s1z >}} Agari : {{< t 1z >}}

This hand contains shuntsu of 123 from 3 different main suits. Since this hand played closed, it's
sanshoku valued 2 han.

{{< t 123m123p123s1z >}} {{< t -678s >}} Agari : {{< t 1z >}}

{{< t 123p67s11z >}} {{< t -123m >}} {{< t -312s >}} Agari : {{< t 8s >}} or {{< t 5s >}}

While having same tiles with the first example, these hands played open and hence the sanshoku only
valued 1 han.

## Value

2 han on closed hand, 1 han on open hand.

## Compatability

`main|Yaku compatability`

`Yaku compatibility table|SDJ`

Sanshoku requires three sequence groups, and thus is incompatible with toitoi, sanshoku doukou,
sanankou, sankantsu, shousangen, honroutou, and chiitoitsu. It is incompatible with honroutou
because honroutou requires either toitoi or chiitoi. Since it requires three suits, it is also
incompatible with honitsu and chinitsu. Finally, while ryanpeikou and ittsu do each require
sequences, their constraints on the sequences are incompatible with those for sanshoku.

### Takame and yasume

`main|Takame and yasume`

Sanshoku is particularly affected by takame and yasume. At times, the tile wait involves a ryanmen
looking for two tile types for the third tile grouping needed for this yaku. In this case, one may
result in sanshoku, while the other does not; and the difference here may involve 1 or 2 han.

{{< t 456m456s45p22266z >}} Agari: {{< t 3p >}} or {{< t 6p >}}

Only the 6-pin produces sanshoku in this case.

### Versus ittsu

![Both ittsu and sanshoku are [apparent](http://tenhou.net/0/?log=2015012320gm-0089-0000-5a33fc94&tw=2&ts=8).](Ittsu_sanshoku.png "Both ittsu and sanshoku are apparent.")
It is possible for both yaku to have potential development in one hand. However, there is no room in
the hand for both yaku to exist. So, when both yaku are apparent, then a point may come during the
hand to make a choice between each of the two yaku.
