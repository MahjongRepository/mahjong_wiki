**Shousangen** {{< kana "小三元" >}} is a standard
[yaku]({{< ref "/riichi/yaku/list-of-yaku.md" >}}), reliant on all three
[sangenpai]({{< ref "/riichi/terminology/jihai.md" >}}). The hand is composed of two
[koutsu]({{< ref "/riichi/terminology/mentsu.md" >}}) (triplet) and a
[jantou]({{< ref "/riichi/terminology/jantou.md" >}}) (pair) of the third type.

## Tile pattern

{{< t 22m340p77666z >}} {{< t 5-55z >}} Yasume: {{< t 2m >}} Takame: {{< t 7z >}}

This hand is a shousangen while winning on the cheaper winning tile. If it wins on the other tile,
{{< t 7z >}}, it would give a [daisangen]({{< ref "/riichi/yakuman/daisangen.md" >}}) yakuman
instead.

## Development

The hand requires two out of the four tile groups to be composed of dragon triplets, while the pair
is always of the third type. That leaves two tile groups to be based off of any tile composition.
Often enough but not always, such a hand may be tenpai for daisangen.

### Compatability

`main|Yaku compatability`

`Yaku compatibility table|SSG`

Shousangen requires [yakuhai]({{< ref "/riichi/rules/yakuhai.md" >}}), from the two groups of dragon
tiles. Note that while normally a yaku is not counted if it is guaranteed by another yaku in the
hand, shousangen does not guarantee a particular yakuhai and so it is counted separately. Out of the
regular four tile groups for a hand, two are dedicated for dragon tiles. So, this yaku has no room
for the likes of [ittsu]({{< ref "/riichi/yaku/ikkitsuukan.md" >}}),
[ryanpeikou]({{< ref "/riichi/yaku/ryanpeikou.md" >}}),
[sanshoku]({{< ref "/riichi/yaku/sanshoku-doujun.md" >}}), and [sanshoku
doukou]({{< ref "/riichi/yaku/sanshoku-doukou.md" >}}), as well as
[chiitoitsu]({{< ref "/riichi/yaku/chiitoitsu.md" >}}) because the later does not allow any mentsu.
Each of those four yaku require at least three tile groups for their specific requirements.
Naturally, [pinfu]({{< ref "/riichi/yaku/pinfu.md" >}}),
[tanyao]({{< ref "/riichi/yaku/tanyao.md" >}}),
[junchan]({{< ref "/riichi/yaku/junchantaiyaochuu.md" >}}), and
[chinitsu]({{< ref "/riichi/yaku/chiniisou.md" >}}) are incompatible because of the dragon tiles.

## Value

In general, this yaku is noted as 2 han. However, it is impossible for this yaku to score without
two instances of [yakuhai]({{< ref "/riichi/rules/yakuhai.md" >}}) from the two groups of sangenpai.
In combination, this yaku will never produce a hand worth less than 4 han. Even with both sangenpai
groups called open, that is a combination of 8 fu; and then there's 2 more fu from the sangenpai
pair of the third type. The hand will almost always score at least
[mangan]({{< ref "/riichi/strategy/scoring-table.md" >}}).

The lowest scoring shousangen is valued at 4 han 30 fu. The requirements to do so, assuming no
additional yaku, are:

- The hand must be won by ron, as a tsumo would score 2 fu.
- The wait must be either a [ryanmen]({{< ref "/riichi/terminology/waits/ryanmen.md" >}}) or
  [shanpon]({{< ref "/riichi/terminology/waits/shanpon.md" >}}) wait, as any other wait would score
  2 fu.
- Both of the other groups must be [shuntsu]({{< ref "/riichi/terminology/mentsu.md" >}}) of
  different suits. If either was a [koutsu]({{< ref "/riichi/terminology/mentsu.md" >}}), it would
  score at least 2 fu.
- Both of the yakuhai groups must be open, as they would score additional fu if closed. Note that as
  this is for the purposes of counting fu, if a group is completed by ron, it counts as being open.
- Neither of the yakuhai groups may be [kantsu]({{< ref "/riichi/terminology/mentsu.md" >}}), as
  they would score additional fu as kantsu.

Two examples scoring exactly 4 han 30 fu on a ron:

{{< t 234p34s66z >}} {{< t 55-5z >}} {{< t -777z >}} Agari: {{< t 5s >}}

{{< t 567m123s6677z >}} {{< t 5-55z >}} Agari: {{< t 6z >}}
