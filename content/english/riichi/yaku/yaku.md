**Yaku** {{< kana "役" >}} are specific hand patterns or conditions needed in order to score a hand.
In a sense, they are synonymous to "poker hands". Yet, unlike poker hands, yaku are worth specific
"han values"; and various yaku may be combined together into one hand. basic mahjong knowledge
involves learning the yaku, but it is not expected of new players to know them. **Most importantly,
every hand must include at least one yaku, in order to count as a winning hand**.

## Han

`main|Scoring`

Each yaku is assigned han values. Most have static values, regardless of the hand being closed or
open. However, some decrease in han value while being open. Furthermore, some also require hands to
remain closed in order to count. For hands to maximize the total han value, different yaku may be
combined into a single hand.

### Open vs closed

`main|Kuisagari`

Various yaku are affected by the hand's state of being open or closed. After using the different
tile calls, a yaku may be affected in terms of han value or even validity. Various yaku, and even
yakuman, are restricted to be closed only. Others, they remain valid but their value is decreased by
1-han. As for the rest, it is irrelevant whether the hand is open or closed.

## Nomi

**Nomi** {{< kana "ノミ" >}} is the state of the hand which contains only one yaku and no dora. In
other words, it is the lowest value (or second lowest value) for that particular yaku possible. In
general, this term can be appended to any of the yaku names as a suffix. For example, **riichi
nomi** {{< kana "リーチノミ" >}} meaning "riichi only". Usually, winning hands in this state are
cheap low value hands worth only 1 or 2 han. Though, the term used for higher valued yaku, such as
ryanpeikou or chinitsu, are acceptable; but it's not generally used. When dora is included in the
hand, then the term is not applicable. As for yakuman, the term nomi is not appended, due to the
high scoring value.

![Yaku_example_07.png](Yaku_example_07.png "Yaku_example_07.png") The different yaku focus on
different types of patterns and circumstances. They are mostly derived from the tiles within one's
hand. A number of yaku also involve the state of one's hand pertaining to the timing of certain tile
draws and discards.

### Discard based

These two are yaku because the hand is tenpai during specific discard timings. Likewise, these two
yaku can never be won via drawing a tile.

- Chankan

<!-- end list -->

-

    Winning with a tile used for an added kan by another player.

<!-- end list -->

- Houtei raoyui

<!-- end list -->

-

    Winning off of the last possible discarded tile for the hand.

### Discretionary

- Riichi

<!-- end list -->

-

    This is the only yaku, by which players have the option to declare or not. Otherwise, hands may possibly win without it, if it remains closed with other valid yaku.

<!-- end list -->

- Double riichi

<!-- end list -->

-

    This is essentially riichi, but with the added luck of the hand being tenpai upon the initial tile deal, or the opening hand.

### Draw based

These are yaku by virtue of the drawn tile. Thus, these three can never be won directly from other
players.

- Haitei raoyue

<!-- end list -->

<!-- end list -->

- Chiniisou

<!-- end list -->

-

    All tiles are the same suit.

### Yakuman

`main|Yakuman` Yakuman is a special class of yaku, by which the pattern itself is awarded the
maximum point limit for a single hand pattern. These are among the most difficult to complete; and
players may treat them as special.

## Combining yaku

`main|Yaku compatability` Different yaku may be implemented into a single hand. By doing so, the
values applied to the different yaku also combine. In short, they stack. This aspect of the game is
key towards developing larger scoring hands. With dora, the stacking effect becomes even greater.

## Optional yaku

`main|Optional yaku`

A list of **optional yaku** exist due to the game's complexity, which can further explore possible
tile combinations and patterns. Regardless, the yaku list noted above is the more commonly accepted
list.
