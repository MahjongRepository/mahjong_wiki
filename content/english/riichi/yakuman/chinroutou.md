**Chinroutou** {{< kana "清老頭" >}} is a yakuman, where every tile is a terminal, or 1's or 9's. No
other tile type are used: no simples (2-8) or honors. For short, it can be referred to as
**chinro**.

## Tile pattern

{{< t 111m99911p99m >}} {{< t 1-11s >}} Agari: {{< t 1p >}} or {{< t 9m >}}

## Routouhai

**Routouhai** {{< kana "老頭牌" >}} are the tiles numbered 1 or 9, among the numbered suits. In
English, they are denoted as **terminals**, because they are at the end of the 1 to 9 number scale
as the numbered suits do not loop. So a tile group such as 9-1-2 does not count, when it comes to
forming tile groups. The terminals are as follows:

{{< t 19s19p19m >}}

## Formation

![Possible [chinroutou threat](http://tenhou.net/0/?log=2015090615gm-0089-0000-acd2836c&tw=3&ts=3) after two calls and a low terminal count among discards.](Chinroutou_denied.png "Possible chinroutou threat after two calls and a low terminal count among discards.")
For this yakuman, there are only six types of terminals available: two from each of the numbered
suit (1 and 9). Simply, no other tile type can be used for this yakuman. Given the basic hand
pattern of four melds and a pair, five out of the six types of terminals are needed to build this
hand. Since there are only six tile types available for this hand, it is impossible to form a
chiitoitsu variation.

### Viability

Aside from needing five out of the six terminal types, every tile group must be triplets. Any calls
for kan are acceptable too. So, any attempt at this yakuman require the proper number of terminals
as well as the ability to collect triplets. More often than not, players must make tile calls in
order to do so. Only a rare number of times can this yakuman be completed while closed. On the other
hand, the yakuman is rendered impossible if enough terminals are discarded or made unavailable.
