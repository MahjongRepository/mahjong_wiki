These [[machi|patterns]] involve waits which are infrequent and generally nameless combinations.  They are all based on combinations of other basic wait patterns, often in many different ways.  They consist of consecutive, or closely consecutive, numbered tiles.  Recognition of these patterns can produce some significantly powerful waits, which may be immune to [[suji]] and have large numbers of waiting tiles. This list is not exhaustive and not every possible waiting pattern is included.

=== 7 tiles ===

This pattern is notable because it has 23 winning tiles, like the [[chuuren poutou|chuuren poutou kyuumen machi]], but unlike most other hands waiting on 23 tiles, it cannot completed by a hypothetical fifth copy of any tile (a 3m or a 7m would not complete this hand).

{{machi
|pattern   = 2344445666678s
|tilewaits = 1235789s
}}

This pattern waits on 23 tiles.

{{machi

{{machi

}}

=== 8 tiles ===
{{machi
|pattern   = 2333344567888m
|tilewaits = 12456789m
}}

This pattern waits on 23 tiles.

{{machi
|pattern   = 2344445678999s
|tilewaits = 12356789s

This pattern waits on 23 tiles.

{{machi
|pattern   = 2223456777p000z
|tilewaits = 12345678p
}}

This pattern waits on 22 tiles.
