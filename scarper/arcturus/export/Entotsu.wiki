'''Entotsu''' {{kana|エントツ}} is a combination [[machi|wait pattern]], that utilizes two basic patterns: [[ryanmen]] and [[shanpon]].  Together, the pattern produces a 3-sided wait, or waits on three tile types.

== Tile pattern ==
:{{#mjt:34555s33000000z}} Waiting for: {{#mjt:2s}}, {{#mjt:5s}}, or {{#mjt:3z}}

The pattern consists of [[tanyao|middle numbered tiles]] and an extra pair of any other tiles.  If the numbered tiles included [[Routouhai|terminals]], then the pattern is a simple shanpon.

'''Example''': ''Not entotsu''
:{{#mjt:77789m44s000000z}} Waiting for: {{#mjt:7m}} or {{#mjt:4s}}

If a 10-man tile exists, then this would be entotsu; but of course, that is not the case.

== Fu ==
{{main|Fu}}

This tile pattern does not reward fu on its own.  Instead, fu is earned via the composition of the [[koutsu|triplet]].  Regardless of the winning tile, the pattern guarantees one triplet.

== Double entotsu ==

:{{#mjt:23444p56777s000z}}  Waiting for: {{#mjt:1p}}, {{#mjt:4p}}, {{#mjt:4s}}, or {{#mjt:7s}}

The wait pattern can be doubled, such that it occurs into one hand.  Essentially, they can be viewed as a pair of [[ryanmen]].  However, this pattern is not possible without the entotsu patterns.
