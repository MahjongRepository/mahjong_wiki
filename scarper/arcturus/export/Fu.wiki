'''Fu''' {{kana|угд}} (''pronounced as foo'') is a component of [[scoring]].  It takes the hand composition into consideration in terms of [[mentsu|tile groups]], [[machi|wait patterns]] and/or win method.  In addition, every hand begins with a default start value of 20 fu.  To determine the final number of ''fu'', the sources of fu are added up along with the base number and then rounded up to the nearest 10.  One exception falls on the yaku [[chiitoitsu]], which is defined and set at 25 fu, regardless of other factors.

==Counting Fu==
===Tile groups===
For shuntsu (sequences), the fu count is 0.  For koutsu (triplet) and kantsu (four-of-a-kind), the fu value depends on whether they are [[tanyaohai]] (simples) or [[jihai]]/[[routouhai]] (honor/terminals).

{| class="wikitable"
|-
! English !! Romaji !! Simples !! Honor/Terminal
|-
| Open triplet || [[Mentsu|Minkou]] ||align=center| 2 fu ||align=center| 4 fu
|-
| Open kan || [[Kan|Minkan]] ||align=center| 8 fu ||align=center| 16 fu
|-
| Closed triplet || [[Mentsu|Ankou]] ||align=center| 4 fu ||align=center| 8 fu
|-
| Closed kan || [[Kan|Ankan]] ||align=center| 16 fu ||align=center| 32 fu
|}

===Waits===

The different [[machi|basic wait patterns]] count for fu as well.  [[Complex machi|Combination wait patterns]] are not listed, such as [[nobetan]], [[sanmentan]], and [[ryanmenten]].  Both nobetan and sanmentan counts for [[tanki]]; and ryanmenten counts for [[ryanmen]].  Other combination patterns factor fu the same as the basic patterns listed here.  However, the fu counts only one time.  For example, a combination of tanki and [[kanchan]] only generates 2 fu from one pattern but not for both.

As for [[shanpon]], the fu generated with this pattern rests on the [[koutsu|tile groupings]] themselves as indicated in the above table.

{| class="wikitable"
|-
! English !! Romaji !! Fu value
|-
| Open wait || [[Ryanmen]] ||align=center| 0 fu
|-
| Closed wait || [[Kanchan]] ||align=center| 2 fu
|-
| Edge wait || [[Penchan]] ||align=center| 2 fu
|-
| Pair wait || [[Tanki]] ||align=center| 2 fu
|}

===Yakuhai pair===

If the hand's pair is of tiles that would score [[yakuhai]] in a koutsu, then this scores 2 fu.  If the pair doubles up as both the round wind and the seat wind, it may score 2 fu, or 4 fu.  That is dependent on which [[Scoring variations#Double Wind Fu|scoring rule]] is used for this case.

===Winning condition===
* Winning with a closed hand by ron, the hand is awarded 10 fu. These 10 fu are called ''menzen-kafu'' and do not count against the player for achieving [[pinfu]].
* A win by tsumo with an open or closed hand is worth 2 fu.
* An exception to the fu for tsumo is a closed hand that satisfies all other criteria for [[pinfu]]. Such a hand does not score 2 fu for tsumo and instead gains the han for pinfu.
* Depending on the [[Scoring variations#Rinshan Fu|scoring rules]] used, a hand won with a kan replacement tile may also be ineligible for the 2 fu for tsumo, instead scoring only the han for [[rinshan kaihou]].
* An open hand won by ron without any fu from koutsu or the waiting pattern (i.e. 20 fu) is forced to 30 fu. This is often described as being worth 2 fu for an open pinfu.

==Maximal Score==

When a hand has multiple waits, or the same wait multiple ways, the way that leads to the highest-scoring hand must be chosen. This will always be the hand with the most [[han]]. This may not necessarily be the option that produces the most fu. The most common reason for this is to score [[pinfu]]. For instance:

:{{#mjt:23345789m567p44s}} Agari: {{#mjt:4m}}

If the hand is viewed as waiting on the ryanmen {{#mjt:23m}}, then it qualifies for pinfu. If, however, the hand is viewed as waiting on the kanchan {{#mjt:35m}}, then it does not. It must be scored as pinfu because that is worth more points.

Pinfu is not, however, the only example of this:

:{{#mjt:789m66678999p789s}} Agari: {{#mjt:5z}}

In this case, there are two options for interpreting the pinzu: either as {{#mjt:66p}}, {{#mjt:678p}}, and {{#mjt:999p}}, or as {{#mjt:666p}}, {{#mjt:789p}}, and {{#mjt:99p}}. Although the triplet of {{#mjt:9p}} is worth more fu, interpreting it as the triplet would deny [[sanshoku]], and so the hand must be interpreted as having the triplet of {{#mjt:6p}}.

== Example: 1 han 110 fu ==

A hand with 1 han and 110 fu is an exceptionally rare hand.  Its requirements are particularly limited, because the hand must be composed of all, not just some, the conditions in the following example.

Example of a '''1 han and 110 fu''' hand:

South player at South round:
:{{#mjt:456m11z22z}} {{#mjt:0z11s0z}} {{#mjt:0z77z0z}} Ron: {{#mjt:1z}}

* 1 han from [[yakuhai]] {{#mjt:7z}}
* base fu: 20
* closed hand ron: 10
* composition of hand:
** {{#mjt:1z}} open triplet: 4
** {{#mjt:1s}} closed quad: 32
** {{#mjt:7z}} closed quad: 32
** {{#mjt:2z}} double wind pair: 4
Total 102, round up to 110

This is the greatest fu count for any hand worth 1 han, and is only attainable if double winds score 4 fu. If the hand is won by tsumo, then [[sanankou]] and [[mentsumo]] will be scored; if the triplet of [[ton|east]] is closed, then [[sanankou]] will still be scored. Finally, the last group must be a sequence, or [[toitoi]] would be scored. In these cases, this would add han to the hand. 

== Example: 2 han 110 fu ==
A hand with 2 han and 110 fu is also possible, as in the following for the East player in the East round:

:{{#mjt:234s1z}} {{#mjt:9999'm}} {{#mjt:0330z}} {{#mjt:0z11p0z}} Tsumo: {{#mjt:1z}}

* 2 han from [[sankantsu]]
* base fu: 20
* tsumo: 2
* pair wait: 2
* composition of hand:
** {{#mjt:9m}} open quad: 16
** {{#mjt:3z}} closed quad: 32
** {{#mjt:1p}} closed quad: 32
** {{#mjt:1z}} double wind pair: 4
Total 108, round up to 110

This is the greatest fu count for any hand worth 2 han. The third quad means that [[sankantsu]] must be the only yaku, but one must still be open in order to avoid [[sanankou]]. Unlike the 1 han 110 fu example, there is a little bit of leeway: for instance, the hand could be completed on a ron without a double wind pair and still score 110 fu.

With the [[mangan]] limit applied, counting this many fu for anything 3 han or higher is no longer relevant, because any han with 70 fu or more is capped at mangan.  If the [[aotenjou]] scoring system is used however, high fu counts remain relevant towards point calculation.

== Open "pinfu" ==
Technically, [[pinfu]] cannot be a yaku while open.  However, some open hands produce 0 fu based on composition alone.

{{#mjt:123m45p22s}} {{#mjt:2'34p6'57s}} Waiting on: {{#mjt:3p}} or {{#mjt:6p}}

This is an open "yakuless" hand.  When closed, it resembles that of pinfu.  Counting the fu from this hand, it produces 0 fu other than the base 20 fu for every hand.  A hand like this can still gain yaku worth 1-han from either [[chankan]], [[haitei]], or [[houtei]].  As far as hands go, this pattern generates an exception to the rule behind counting fu; and as a special case, it is granted 2 fu in order to be rounded up to 30 fu.

== Shortcuts for Counting ==

To be able to announce hand scores quickly, it helps to know some shortcuts for counting fu. These shortcuts take advantage of the fact that fu is always rounded up to the next 10.

* [[chiitoitsu]]: fixed at 25 fu
* [[toitoi]]: almost always 40 fu (see below)
* [[pinfu]]: ron is always 30 fu, tsumo is always 20 fu
* Closed hand without [[pinfu]]: ron is almost always 40 fu, tsumo is almost always 30 fu
* Open hand: almost always 30 fu

These shortcuts don't work for hands that have quads since those are worth enough fu by themselves to have a significant influence on the total. In that case, it's better to simply count the fu properly.

"Almost always" means that there are a few exceptions which may raise the fu past the shortcut value. In particular, look for these elements in the hand's composition:

* at least one concealed set of terminal/honor tiles
* at least two open sets of terminal/honor tiles
* one open set of terminal/honor tiles and one concealed set of simples
* at least two concealed sets of simples

All of the above are worth 8 fu and thus may raise the total fu count by 10 when combined with the 2 fu for tsumo or for having difficult wait.

Counting fu for [[toitoi]] is a bit trickier but only ''open'' [[toitoi]] hands need to be considered: if you win a closed [[toitoi]] hand by tsumo, it's a yakuman ([[suuankou]]) and if you win a closed [[toitoi]] hand by ron, it's a mangan or higher ([[toitoi]] + [[sanankou]]). Also, a [[toitoi]] hand with only terminals/honors is [[honroutou]], also worth at least a mangan. Thus, an open [[toitoi]] hand with no quads for which counting fu actually matters will almost always score 40 fu.
