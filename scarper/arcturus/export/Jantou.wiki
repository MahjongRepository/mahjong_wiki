'''Jantou'''{{kana|雀頭}} means the pair in the winning hand.  In English, it can be referred to as "the pair" or the eye.  Every winning hand requires one jantou.  Even the irregular yakuman [[kokushi musou]] requires one jantou.  [[Chiitoitsu]] is a notable yaku, because it requires seven of them.

== Fu ==
Certain tile pairs produces [[fu]].  Each produces 2 fu.  Any other pair combinations not listed is worth 0 fu.

* [[Sangenpai]] (Dragon)
* [[Yakuhai|Jikazehai]] (Seat wind)
* [[Yakuhai|Bakazehai]] (Round wind)

Essentially, if these tiles were completed by drawing a third or [[pon]] was called, then they may qualify for [[yakuhai]], where appropriate.

== Tanki ==

:{{#mjt:234p444m6z}} {{#mjt:1'1155'5z}}  Waiting for: {{#mjt:6z}}

Only one [[machi|wait pattern]] involves the pair directly: [[tanki]].  It is conveniently known in English as the "pair wait".  This pattern only arises, when the hand contains four complete [[tile groups]].
