'''Kanchan''' {{kana|嵌張}} is a [[machi|wait pattern]] that completes with the middle number of a [[shuntsu|sequence]].  

==Pattern==

{{#mjt:00000z46m000000z}}

==Fu==
{{main|Fu}}

Kanchan is awarded 2 fu upon winning.  A closed hand winning by ron automatically becomes [[mangan]], if it scores 4 han.

==Strategy==
Kanchan is similar to [[penchan]], by which it waits on 4 tiles maximum for a single numbered tile type for completion.  Likewise, this pattern can hide against [[suji]].  However, kanchan is more versatile as it is able to use a greater range of tile types.
