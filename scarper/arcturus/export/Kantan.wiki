'''Kantan''' is a named combination [[machi|wait]], which features to basic patterns of [[kanchan]] and [[tanki]].  It is formed with a numbered [[ankou|closed triplet]] tied with a number tile two away from said triplet.

== Tile pattern ==
{{#mjt:1113m000000000z}} Waiting for: {{#mjt:2m}} or {{#mjt:3m}}

== Fu ==
At minimum, the pattern produces 2 fu either by the kanchan or the tanki wait.  If it wins with the tanki wait, then additional fu is generated from the triplet.
