== Three-han and above ==

=== Ikkitsuukan chantaiyaochuu ===
'''Ikkitsuukan chantaiyaochuu''' {{kana|一気通貫全帯么九}} (''Pure straight with mixed outside-hand''), as its literal meaning, is a mixture hand of [[ikkitsuukan]] and [[chantaiyaochuu]].  More specifically, aside from the shuntsu of 456 in ittsuu part, the rest of hand should satisfy the condition of chanta.  Also called '''Ittsuu chanta''' {{kana|イッツーチャンタ}} in short.

* Value: 4 han (3 han when opened, supercedes ittsuu)
* Example: {{#mjt:11789p123456789s}}

Under the general ruleset, such two hands are only valued as ittsuu. As how ittsuu and chanta are defined, they're mutually exclusive and there's no chance to score them together.

=== Tanfonhou ===
'''Tanfonhou''' {{kana|断紅和}} is a hand built by tiles <span style="color:red;">without red</span>.  That being said, only the following tiles are available:

* Trivia:
** The kanji prefix "chin" {{kana|清}} in mahjong is generally used to indicate a yaku variant which is built without containing [[honor]] tiles.  However there's no such meaning in this yaku, this hand can be actually built with jihai.

== Mangan for actions taking on specific tiles ==
The following listed yakus are achieved by taking actions on some particular tiles.  Generally speaking, these yakus are inspired by some idioms, verses, or simply the tile patterns.

There're two common scoring mechanics on them:
# Directly scored as a mangan, unless the hand can be scored higher in another way.
# Additional 1-han based on the specific operations, which on essence values 2-han in total.

Sometimes both two scoring methods are applied simultaneously, the actual value will be always picked as the highest one.

Similar to [[tenhou and chiihou]], any calling actions will nullify the yaku.

* Value: Mangan / Baiman / Yakuman
* Example: {{#mjt:45m456678p55s666z}}, Ron: {{#mjt:3m}} (Turn 0). <ref group="replay" name="replay-renhou">[https://mahjongsoul.game.yo-star.com/?paipu=190218-8fda4352-0ce1-4510-a61e-32ccdd01ab4c_a89432143 Renhou] (East 1 Round, South seat)</ref>

=== Maneman ===
'''Maneman''' {{kana|真似満}} is a yaku achieved by mimicking opponent's discards. Also called '''Maneshi mangan''' {{kana|真似満貫}}.

Generally speaking, if a player has their discards identical to some opponent in the first row (usually from 1st to 5th / 6th turn), maneman is applied and the opponent will lose a mangan to that player.

Similar to [[nagashi mangan]], the condition breaks if anybody melded some tiles required by the yaku, though it doesn't hurt if the melded tile is not related to the repeated part.
* Value: Mangan

Some variations may exist under different rulesets:
* Can only imitate the discards from a dealer, meaning only non-dealers can achieve this yaku.
* Value can be increased if more tiles are mimicked, e.g. 7th turn haneman, 9th turn baiman, and so on.

=== Paarenchan ===
'''Paarenchan''' {{kana|八連荘}} (lit. ''Eight consecutive dealership'') is a special winning state related to [[renchan]]. Roughly speaking, if a player successfully keeps his dealership for eight countinous rounds, or simply wins eight hands continuously, the hand he won at the last time will be automatically scored as a yakuman, as long as it is a valid winning hand, no matter how small is its actual value.

More specifically, there're three main variants to determine a paarenchan:
: '''Definition 1''': Winning eight hands consecutively, no matter if the player is the dealer at that round.
: '''Definition 2''': Winning eight hands continuously exactly in his own dealership (as how the yaku name strictly indicated).
: '''Definition 3''': Successfully accumulates eight [[honba]] points on his own. Usually a hand must be won at the last honba, while it doesn't matter for the previous ones.

Usually an optional restriction of [[ryanhan shibari|ryanhan-shibari]] will be applied to the dealer after the fifth round.  That being said, the dealer can only claim a winning hand with at least 2 han from yakus, otherwise the progress will halt.

* Value: Yakuman

The following charts show their differences on tracking a valid state of paarenchan:

Depending on ruleset, the dealership may automatically rotate after paarenchan, or allowing to continue the next loop of paarenchan progress.

=== Pouhoi paarenchan ===
With the rule of [[#Paarenchan|paarenchan]] applied, if a non-dealer breaks opponent's dealership successfully at the round the dealer can achieve paarenchan, '''Pouhoi paarenchan''' {{kana|破回八連荘}} (lit. ''Destroyed eighth-dealership'') is achieved.  The non-dealer winner will automatically scored a yakuman, no matter how much his hand actually values.
* Value: Yakuman

Unlike paarenchan, the [[ryanhan shibari|ryanhan-shibari]] restriction is not applied to the non-dealers.

In some ruleset, the winning condition is limited to either tsumo, or ron from the dealer.

=== Ishino uenimo sannen ===
'''Ishino uenimo sannen''' {{kana|石の上にも三年}} (lit. ''Three years on a rock'') is a yaku achieved by winning a [[daburu riichi|double-riichi]] hand with [[haitei raoyue and houtei raoyui|haitei raoyue / houtei raoyui]].
* Value: Yakuman
* Example:
** Double riichi: {{#mjt:44m446699p22s344z}}, Houtei ron: {{#mjt:3z}} <ref group="replay" name="replay-ishino-uenimo-sannen">[https://mahjongsoul.game.yo-star.com/?paipu=190910-4cc3e29e-a89e-4283-86a4-365665fd9017_a96324914 Ishino uenimo sannen] (South 4 Round 1 honba, East seat)</ref>
* Trivia:
** The name of yaku is an idiom about patience. It comes from the aphorism {{kana|石の上にじっと3年も座っていれば、石も暖まる}}, meaning "even a cold stone can be warmed if someone sits on it for three years", indicating the perseverance leads to a success.

=== Toukanhou ===
'''Toukanhou''' {{kana|頭槓和}} (lit. ''First-kan win'') is a yaku achieved by claiming a [[kan]] in the first turn and win with [[rinshan kaihou]] immediately.

Similarly to [[tenhou and chiihou]], the yaku will be nullified with any preceding calling actions from the opponents.

Due to the required action of kan, this yaku is not available to combine with tenhou and chiihou.

Depending on rulesets, the type of kan may be limited to [[ankan]]-only, or can only be achieved by the dealer.

* Value: Yakuman

=== Shiisanpuutaa / Shiisuupuutaa ===
'''Shiisanpuutaa''' / '''Shiisanputou''' {{kana|十三不塔}} (lit. ''Thirteen unconnected'') is a special starting hand with none of the two tiles (in thirteen different tiles) can be formed as a [[taatsu]], aside from exactly one pair.
* Value: Yakuman
* Example: {{#mjt:3669m47p48s123456z}} <ref group="replay" name="replay-shiisanpuutaa">[https://mahjongsoul.game.yo-star.com/?paipu=190709-bcacfe3e-1f13-4411-b845-fbe888684a36_a89351545 Shiisanpuutaa] (East 2 Round 2 honba, East seat)</ref>

Likewise, if all the fourteen different tiles are mutually exclusive, this starting hand becomes '''Shiisanuushi''' {{kana|十三無靠}}.  Sometimes also noted as '''Shiisuupuutaa''' / '''Shiisuuputou''' {{kana|十四不塔}} (lit. ''Fourteen unconnected'').
* Value: Yakuman
* Example: {{#mjt:148s26p149m12567z}} {{#mjt:3z}}

Similar to [[tenhou and chiihou]], these yakus are only recognized in the first turn of each player, and any calling actions will nullify the yaku.

=== Suurenkou ===
'''Suurenkou''' {{kana|四連刻}} (lit. ''Four consecutive triplets'') is a hand containing four triplets (or quads) in one suit where their numbers are increased by 1.
* Value: Yakuman
* Example: {{#mjt:2777888p}} {{#mjt:666'p}} {{#mjt:999'p}}, Ron: {{#mjt:2p}} <ref group="replay" name="replay-suurenkou">[https://mahjongsoul.game.yo-star.com/?paipu=190328-799d4453-5f7d-499f-9b03-3e0f2e73aa0a_a88943782 Suurenkou] (South 1 Round 1 honba, East seat)</ref>

The following hand is also called '''Junsei suurenkou''' {{kana|純正四連刻}} (lit. ''Pure four consecutive triplets''): [[shanpon]]-machi with either waits ensures a suurenkou.
* Example: {{#mjt:1155m}} {{#mjt:222'm}} {{#mjt:333'm}} {{#mjt:44'4m}}, Agari: {{#mjt:1m}} / {{#mjt:5m}}

The rule of [[sekinin barai]] can be applied in this yakuman hand.
: {{#mjt:4z}}, last:{{#mjt:44'4s}}, formers: {{#mjt:6'66s}} {{#mjt:555's}} {{#mjt:77'77s}}
: Toimen becomes liable for feeding the last required set: souzu of 4.

=== Suuchoupaikou ===
'''Suuchoupaikou''' {{kana|四跳牌刻}} is a hand with four triplets (or quads) in one suit where their numbers are increased by 2.

This yaku is a less common variant of [[#Suurenkou|suurenkou]].
* Value: Usually yakuman
* Example: {{#mjt:222888p11m}} {{#mjt:666'p}} {{#mjt:4'44p}}

The rule of [[sekinin barai]] can be applied in this yakuman hand.
: {{#mjt:9m}}, last:{{#mjt:333's}}, formers: {{#mjt:0z99s0z}} {{#mjt:555's}} {{#mjt:77'7s}}
: Shimocha becomes liable for feeding the last required set: souzu of 3.

=== Daisharin / Daichikurin / Daisuurin ===
{{main|Daisharin}}
'''Daisharin''' {{kana|大車輪}} (''Big wheels'') is a closed hand with a pattern of 22334455667788 in [[pinzu]].
Likewise, '''Daichikurin''' {{kana|大竹林}} (''Bamboo forest'') and '''Daisuurin''' {{kana|大数隣}} (''Numerous numbers'') is achieved by using the same pattern in [[souzu]] and [[manzu]] respectively.
* Value: Yakuman
* Examples:
** {{#mjt:2233455667788p}}, Ron: {{#mjt:4p}} (Daisharin) <ref group="replay" name="replay-daisharin">[http://tenhou.net/3/?log=2019121821gm-008f-0000-9af6d7e1&tw=1&ts=9 Daisharin] (South 4 Round, West seat)</ref>
** {{#mjt:2234405667788s}}, Tsumo: {{#mjt:3s}} (Daichikurin) <ref group="replay" name="replay-daichikurin">[http://tenhou.net/3/?log=2019082421gm-0029-0000-60867ab9&tw=0&ts=5 Daichikurin] (East 4 Round 3 honba, South seat)</ref>
** {{#mjt:2233445566778m}}, Ron: {{#mjt:8m}} (Daisuurin) <ref group="replay" name="replay-daisuurin">[http://tenhou.net/3/?log=2020010519gm-0007-0000-4c243150&tw=3&ts=3 Daisuurin] (East 3 Round 1 honba, South seat)</ref>
* Trivia:
** When this yaku is not recognized, such hand scores at least a sanbaiman (11 han), with [[tanyao]]'s 1 han + [[pinfu]]'s 1 han + [[ryanpeikou]]'s 3 han + [[chinitsu]]'s 6 han.
** The concrete definition of daisharin may vary in each platform. Some is defined as ryanpeikou, while some is defined by [[chiitoitsu]]. These definitions in fact generate an identical pattern of a concealed hand, and it doesn't hurt under the general ruleset of japanese mahjong. However this will influence the available stacking yakus under [[aotenjou]] rules, which finally brings a different sum-up result.

=== Shousharin / Shouchikurin / Shousuurin ===
'''Shousharin''' {{kana|小車輪}} is a concealed hand with seven consecutive [[pinzu]] pairs from 1 to 7, or from 3 to 9.  Similarly, '''Shouchikurin''' {{kana|小竹林}} and '''Shousuurin''' {{kana|小数隣}} are the variants of [[souzu]] and [[manzu]] correspondingly.
* Value: Usually yakuman, sometimes sanbaiman or even lower
* Examples:
** {{#mjt:3344566778899p}}, Tsumo: {{#mjt:5p}} (Shousharin) <ref group="replay" name="replay-shousharin">[http://tenhou.net/3/?log=2019102310gm-0089-0000-6b99581b&tw=1&ts=1 Shousharin] (East 2 Round, East seat)</ref>
** {{#mjt:1122334056677s}}, Tsumo: {{#mjt:4s}} (Shouchikurin) <ref group="replay" name="replay-shouchikurin">[http://tenhou.net/3/?log=2019111420gm-0009-0000-56b76d97&tw=3&ts=5 Shouchikurin] (South 1 Round, North seat)</ref>
* Trivia:
** When the yaku is not recognized, such hand values at least a baiman (9 han), with [[chinitsu]]'s 6 han + [[ryanpeikou]]'s 3 han. Unlike daisharin, [[pinfu]] is not always guaranteed.
** The usage of yaku is not as common as daisharin. Usually this yaku is defined accompanying with daisharin as a weaker version.

=== Isshoku yonjun ===
'''Isshoku yonjun''' / '''Iisou suushun''' {{kana|一色四順}} (lit. ''Pure quadruple sequences'') is a hand containing four identical [[shuntsu]]s in a same suit. Also knowned as '''Suuren taihou''' {{kana|四連太宝}}.

The winning condition may vary between closed-hand only, or opened-hand allowed.  Though even with an openable choice, this hand is still pretty rare, and really hard to accomplish.  The difficulty comes from the process of collecting those twelve tiles with continuous numbers in one suit, while only the [[kamicha]] can help to feed the tiles.  This is also why this yaku generally doesn't apply the [[kuisagari]] rule to downgrade the value of an opened hand, which is usually widely applied for shuntsu-based yakus.
* Value: Yakuman
* Example: {{#mjt:11m223344s}} {{#mjt:2'34s}} {{#mjt:4'23s}}

The rule of [[sekinin barai]] can be applied in this yakuman hand.  Due to the limitation on claiming [[Naki#Chii|chii]], only kamicha can be the target of responsibility.
: {{#mjt:5m}}, last: {{#mjt:9'78p}}, formers: {{#mjt:7'89p}} {{#mjt:8'79p}} {{#mjt:8'79p}}
: Kamicha becomes liable for feeding the last required set.

=== Hyakuman goku ===
'''Hyakuman goku''' {{kana|百万石}} (lit. ''Million piculs'') is a [[chinitsu]] hand of [[manzu]] where all of their numbers can be summed up to over a hundred.  As how the yaku name indicated, a million is achieved by multiplying 100 by ten thousands, the unit of manzu.
* Value: Yakuman
* Examples:
** {{#mjt:2366677m}} {{#mjt:0z88m0z}} {{#mjt:9999'm}}, Agari: {{#mjt:1m}} (106) / {{#mjt:4m}} (109)
** {{#mjt:2256799m}} {{#mjt:7'77m}} {{#mjt:88"8m}}, Agari: {{#mjt:9m}} (102), Yasume: {{#mjt:2m}} (95)
** {{#mjt:55567999m}} {{#mjt:77'7m}} {{#mjt:888'm}} (100 exactly)
** {{#mjt:55m}} {{#mjt:6"66m}} {{#mjt:7'777m}} {{#mjt:888"m}} {{#mjt:0z99m0z}} (130 maximum)
* Some variation may exists as follows:
** Only scores the exactly 100 cases as a yakuman.
** Scores the exactly 100 cases as a double yakuman. Such hand is also called '''Kaga hyakuman goku''' {{kana|加賀百万石}} / '''Junsei hyakuman goku''' {{kana|純正百万石}} (lit. ''Pure million piculs'').
** May allow summing up a hand for [[honitsu]].
* Trivia:
** A [[wikipedia:picul|picul]] (石, or 担) is an ancient unit of weight in Asia.  The actual weight may be a bit off, but roughly it's defined by "as much as a man can carry on a shoulder-pole", at around 50 to 60 kilograms.

== Yakumans related to specific tiles ==

=== Kachoufuugetsu / Fuukasetsugetsu ===
'''Kachoufuugetsu''' {{kana|花鳥風月}} is a hand built by four types of each triplets (or quads):
: Hana {{kana|花}} (''Flower''): Pinzu of 5
: Tori {{kana|鳥}} (''Bird''): Souzu of 1
: Kaze {{kana|風}} (''Wind''): [[Jihai#Kazehai|Bakaze or jikaze]]
: Tsuki {{kana|月}} (''Moon''): Pinzu of 1
Likewise, '''Fuukasetsugetsu''' {{kana|風花雪月}} is built by triplets (or quads) of Kaze (風), Hana (花), Tsuki (月) and:
: Yuki {{kana|雪}} (''Snow''): [[Sangenpai]] haku
No further restriction on picking the pair.
* Value: Both are yakuman
* Example: 
** {{#mjt:88m111s11150p}} {{#mjt:22'2z}}, Tsumo: {{#mjt:5p}} (Kachoufuugetsu) <ref group="replay" name="replay-kachoufuugetsu">[[:File:Saki-Kachoufuugetsu.png|Kachoufuugetsu]] (manga ''Saki'', ch.40)</ref>
** {{#mjt:1s333555z}} {{#mjt:5'00p}} {{#mjt:11'1p}}, Ron: {{#mjt:1s}} (Fuukasetsugetsu) <ref group="replay" name="replay-fuukasetsugetsu">[[:File:Saki-Fuukasetsugetsu.png|Fuukasetsugetsu]] (manga ''Saki'', ch.39)</ref>
* Trivia:
** Both Kachoufuugetsu (花鳥風月) and Fuukasetsugetsu (風花雪月) are idioms for describing a beautiful night landscape.

== Yakumans related to tile color ==

=== Kouitten ===
'''Kouitten''' {{kana|紅一点}} (lit. ''A little red'') is a hand similar to [[ryuuiisou]] by replacing the [[sangenpai]] hatsu to the <span style="color:red; font-weight:bold;">red</span> one: sangenpai chun.  Also called '''Ittenkou''' {{kana|一点紅}}.

The sangenpai chun is required to complete the hand, similarly to the early restriction on ryuuiisou.

* Value: Yakuman
* Example: {{#mjt:22244888s777z}} {{#mjt:6'66s}}
* Trivia:
** The yaku name originates from the verse {{kana|萬緑叢中紅一點}}, lit. ''A little <span style="color:red;">red</span> in the <span style="color:green">greenery</span>''.

=== Benikujaku ===
'''Benikujaku''' {{kana|紅孔雀}} (lit. ''Red peacock'') is a hand only built by the <span style="color:red; font-weight:bold;">red</span> [[souzu]] tiles (souzu of 1, 5, 7 and 9) and [[Jihai#Sangenpai|sangenpai chun]].

This yaku is harder than [[ryuuiisou]] and [[chinroutou]], as it only contains five kinds of available tiles, and they can't perform any [[shuntsu]].
* Value: Yakuman
* Example: {{#mjt:5777999s}} {{#mjt:111's}} {{#mjt:777'z}}, Agari: {{#mjt:0s}} <ref group="replay" name="replay-benikujaku">[https://mahjongsoul.game.yo-star.com/?paipu=191218-690009fa-24d9-4d02-b595-9de8ea1a12bf_a95280650 Benikujaku] (East 2 Round, East seat)</ref>
* Trivia:
** This yaku is derived from ryuuiisou, as it utilizes the tiles not used by ryuuiisou.  It used to have a name '''Kouiisou''' {{kana|紅一色}} (lit. ''All red''), but it's vague due to the fact there're many other tiles also containing red.  Hence, this hand is renamed with the peacock pattern of the 1-sou.

=== Kokuiisou ===
'''Kokuiisou''' / '''Heiiisou''' {{kana|黒一色}} (lit. ''All black'') is a hand built only by the <span style="color:darkblue; font-weight:bold;">black</span> tiles: the [[pinzu]] of 2 / 4 / 6 and four kinds of [[kazehai]].

The hand is available in either [[toitoi]] or [[chiitoitsu|chiitoi]] form.
* Value: Yakuman (or sanbaiman in some rules)
* Examples:
** {{#mjt:44888p111333z}} {{#mjt:222'p}}
** {{#mjt:224488p11223344z}}

=== Ryuuiisourin / Kouittenrin ===
'''Ryuuiisourin''' {{kana|緑一色輪}} is a hand similar to [[ryuuiisou]] by replacing the pair with the souzu of 5.  Likewise, we get '''Kouittenrin''' {{kana|紅一点輪}} by replacing the pair based on a [[#Kouitten|kouitten]] hand.

Such hands are available in [[chiitoitsu]] form, as they both contain seven kinds of available tiles to build a hand.

* Value: Yakuman
* Example:
** {{#mjt:23455666888s666z}} (Ryuuiisourin)
** {{#mjt:223344556688s77z}} (Kouittenrin)

== Yakumans related to specific things ==

=== Golden Gate Bridge ===
'''Golden Gate Bridge''' {{kana|ゴールデンゲートブリッジ、金門橋}} is a hand containing all four [[shuntsu]]s of 123, 345, 567 and 789 in one suit.

The yaku name is inspired from the [[wikipedia:Golden Gate Bridge|Golden Gate Bridge]] in San Francisco.  The "pair"s of 33 / 55 / 77 indicates the piers of bridge, while the whole group of sequences with tiles from 1 to 9 indicates the bridge deck.

* Value: Yakuman
* Example: {{#mjt:99m12334556779p}}, Tsumo: {{#mjt:8p}} <ref group="replay" name="replay-golden-gate-bridge">[https://mahjongsoul.game.yo-star.com/?paipu=190730-2529bd8b-1157-4b41-8fb6-42fa905fb6f6_a92631884 Golden Gate Bridge] (South 2 Round, South seat)</ref>

Depending on rulesets, different restrictions may be applied, such as:
* Closed-hand only
* Restricted in [[chinitsu]]-form only
* Head pair must be 5 in the same suit, which makes the hand even harder (may sometimes valued double yakuman in this case)
** The stack of four 5-tiles indicates the structure of largest pier in the middle.

=== American Civil War ===
'''Nanboku sensou''' {{kana|南北戦争}} (''American Civil War'') is a hand built with two triplets of South and North, a set of "1861" in identical suit, and a set of "1865" in another suit.
* Restriction:
** Menzenchin only.
** The triplet of South / North is usually not allowed to meld or claim as [[ankan]].
** The two groups of years are usually not allowed in a same suit.
* Value: Yakuman
* Example: {{#mjt:1861p1865s222444z}}
* Trivia:
** The yaku originates from [[wikipedia:American_Civil_War|American Civil War]].  Two sets of numbers indicate its starting year 1861 and the ending year 1865, while two sets of honors indicate the two belligerents: southern United States and northern United States.
** The yaku comes from American mahjong, which generally doesn't follow the pattern of traditional mahjong (multiple sets and a pair).
<!--
=== Nanbokuchou period ===

=== Satsuma Rebellion / Seinan War ===
-->
=== Tohoku Expressway ===
'''Touhoku jidoushadou''' {{kana|東北自動車道}} (''Tohoku Expressway'') is a hand only using pinzu of 2 / 4 / 6 and [[kazehai]] of East / North.

The pinzu of 2 / 4 / 6 represents [[wikipedia:Two-wheeler|two-wheelers]] ([[wikipedia:ja:二輪車|二輪車]]), ordinary cars ([[wikipedia:ja:普通自動車|普通車]]), and large cars ([[wikipedia:ja:大型自動車|大型車]]) correspondingly.

* Value: Yakuman
* Example: {{#mjt:222444666p11144z}}
* Trivia:
** This yaku is used in manga series ''Shounenjanki Higashi'' ([[wikipedia:ja:少年雀鬼-東-|少年雀鬼-東-]]).
** The yaku comes into being in 1987, the year when the route of [[wikipedia:Tōhoku Expressway|Tohoku Expressway]] between Kawaguchi JCT and Urawa IC is accomplished and fully opened.

=== Tohoku Shinkansen ===
'''Touhoku Shinkansen''' {{kana|東北新幹線}} (''Tohoku Shinkansen'') is a hand built with [[kazehai]] East and North as the pair and a triplet, and an [[ikkitsuukan]] hand as the rest.
* Value: Yakuman (usually closed-hand only)
* Example: {{#mjt:123456789s11144z}}
* Trivia:
** This yaku is considered to be designed in 1980s, when the rail line of [[wikipedia:Tōhoku_Shinkansen|Tohoku Shinkansen]] is completed and opened.
** In some early version, the ittsuu part is limited into souzu-only / pinzu-only, indicating the two-tone coloring style (green and white) used in early high-speed trains of [[wikipedia:200 Series Shinkansen|200 Series Shinkansen]], or the wheels of the train, correspondingly.
** In some platform, this yaku is avaiable in an opened-hand with a value from mangan to baiman.

=== Blue Tunnel ===
'''Aonodoumon''' {{kana|青ノ洞門}} (''Ao no Domon'', lit. ''Blue Tunnel'') is a [[toitoi]] hand built with pinzu of 2 / 4 / 8, [[sangenpai]] hatsu, and one kind of arbitrary [[kazehai]].
* Value: Yakuman
* Example: {{#mjt:22244488p}} {{#mjt:333'z}} {{#mjt:66'6z}}
* Trivia:
** [[wikipedia:Aonodōmon|Ao no Domon]] is a tourist attraction in Yabakei gorge, now part of Nakatsu City, Oita Prefecture, in Japan.
** This hand is invented by a Japanese author [[wikipedia:Kan_Kikuchi|Kan Kikuchi]], who recorded the stories about Ao no Domon in his book ''Onshuu no Kanata ni'' {{kana|[[wikipedia:恩讐の彼方に|恩讐の彼方に]]}}. He is also an avid player on mahjong.

== Multiple yakuman ==

=== Chousangen ===
