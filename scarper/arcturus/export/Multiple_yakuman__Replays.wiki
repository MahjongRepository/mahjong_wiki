Only a limited number of [[yakuman]] may combine to produce higher scoring hands than regular yakuman.  This is only assuming the rules allow [[multiple yakuman]] in the first place.

After toimen riichi, broke tenpai to hold onto the winds. Shortly after kamicha riichi, completed [[suuankou]] [[daisuushii]].

| comment = Opening hand is weak with lots of different honours, but has two dora. By the 9th go-around, the hand is tenpai for chiitoitsu honitsu dora 2, a haneman, with pairs of all four winds and haku. With only two winds in the river, when toimen discards ton, it is ponned. Pons of nan and shaa off of kamicha follow, with live dora discarded. The ron of toimen gives daisuushii tsuuiisou. It is interesting that the winds were ponned in order.

| comment = Triple yakuman, where the hand was already tenpai for [[ryanmen]] for shousuushi.  Then the hand was switched to suuankou tanki, when the east pair became a triplet.  Toimen failed to prevent the yakuman by passing up winning tiles twice.  Finally, a play was made to risk completion of the hand by going to a [[hell wait]] with two haku already discarded.  The hand was finished anyways.

| comment = [[Chinroutou]] [[Suukantsu]] in a 7447 game.  A number of scenarios could have prevented this combination:
# The player could have declined any tile call, especially the calls for [[daiminkan]].
# The other players could have withheld the [[terminals]].
# Any of the tile calls during the hand shifted the draw order.
# [[Shimocha]] had a much faster tenpai and retained a [[shanpon]] wait instead of switching to [[ryanmen]], which would have won.
# Toimen had a winning hand during the 2-pin discard but was furiten. Though, toimen temporarily disconnected.
# The 8-man discard could have been called for a "fifth kan", but [[Tenhou.net rules|the rules]] do not allow that.
# The hand won on the [[haiteihai|haitei draw]].
