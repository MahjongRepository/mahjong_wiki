'''Sashikomi''' {{kana|差し込み}} is the deliberate act of dealing dangerous tiles, in order for another player to win the hand.  Normally, players with a large enough point difference can afford the point loss and retain placement.  The primary purpose of this strategy intends to either force a wind rotation or outright end the game.

==Usage==
To use this strategy, a player must either have a sizable lead, a marginal point lead vs the next player in placement, and/or familiarity with the [[scoring table]].  Furthermore, the player must defend against particular players; or else the strategy is rendered moot by not accomplishing its goal.  For example, for the [[oorasu|last hand]] of the game, players should defend against the last dealer in order to prevent [[renchan|additional hands]]; and otherwise, the last dealer has a chance to win the game by winning enough consecutive and/or large enough hands as the last dealer.
