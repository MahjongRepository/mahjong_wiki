'''Space mahjong''' is a modified set of rules to mahjong.  Here, the limitations on terminal tiles and honor tile are removed.  Normally, the 1-9 scale ends with 1 and 9 as terminals.  In this set of rules, the number sequence is given the wrap around effect when it comes to the formation of tile groupings.

== Tile groupings ==
Due to the wrap around effect, the terminal tiles operate just like any other numbered tile.  

=== Numbered tiles ===

=== Honor tiles ===
With wrap-around effect, honor tiles become significantly important, for the fact that honor-related yakus are usually in high value, as well as they can now form mentsus efficiently.

Any three different tiles of kazehais / sangenpais can be formed as a valid shuntsu. That means all of the following sets are valid:

{{#mjt:123z}}, {{#mjt:234z}}, {{#mjt:341z}}, {{#mjt:412z}}, {{#mjt:567z}}.

Any two different tiles of kazehais / sangenpais can be formed as a valid taatsu:
* {{#mjt:12z}}, ryanmen waiting for both {{#mjt:3z}} and {{#mjt:4z}}.
* {{#mjt:13z}}, kanchan waiting for both {{#mjt:2z}} and {{#mjt:4z}}.
* {{#mjt:56z}}, waiting for {{#mjt:7z}}, can be interpreted as either kanchan or ryanmen.

Four different tiles of kazehais can be formed as a 4-sided tanki wait:
* {{#mjt:1234z}}, tanki waiting for {{#mjt:1234z}}.

== Yakus ==

=== Tanyao ===
There's no more special combination generated by this ruleset. Everything works as still.

=== Chanta / Junchan ===
Aside from honor-tile shuntsus, there're two more available combinations of numbered-tile shuntsus: 891 and 912. This makes chanta and junchan become much easier than in regular rules.

:{{#mjt:912m891p11s56z}} {{#mjt:1'24z}} Agari: {{#mjt:7z}}

=== Honroutou ===
The restriction of Toitoi / Chiitoi-based hand no longer applies, as honors can be used for shuntsus.

The following hand shows how it is possible with Honroutou-nomi.

:{{#mjt:99m111p11s234z}} {{#mjt:99'9p}} Agari: {{#mjt:9m1s}}

=== Kokushi Musou ===
Opened kokushi is no longer unavailable since honor tiles can be grouped as shuntsus.

:{{#mjt:19m19p119s}} {{#mjt:2'34z}} {{#mjt:6'57z}} Agari: {{#mjt:1z}}

Though the value of such opened hand is usually reduced for balancing purpose (e.g. 2 ~ 3 hans), since it makes kokushi musou significantly easier than menzen one.

=== Junsei Chuuren Poutou ===
Theoretically a 9-sided wait hand is no longer restricted to the regular form since numbered tiles can be wrapped around. That means such hand 

:{{#mjt:1233344456789p}} Agari: {{#mjt:347p}} (in regular rules)

can be interpreted as:

:{{#mjt:4445678912333p}} Agari: {{#mjt:456789123p}} (in space mahjong rules)

Though depending on rule details this may be recognized as a valid chuuren, or maybe not.
