'''Tanki''' {{kana|単騎}} is a common type of [[machi|wait pattern]].  Most mahjong hands form to complete the fourth [[mentsu|meld]].  However, a handful of mahjong hands can be formed with four complete melds, while needing to finish the [[jantou|pair]].  That makes this pattern referred to as the "pair wait".  Unlike the other basic patterns, there are a few types of pair waits to consider.

==Pattern==
{{#mjt:000000000000z4p}}

The wait pattern involves waiting for a single tile.

===Hadaka tanki===

{{#mjt:4p}} {{#mjt:0'000'000'000'00z}}

'''Hadaka tanki''' {{kana|裸単騎}} is a special type of pair wait pattern.  A hand in this state has [[naki|called for discarded tiles]] four times.  Upon doing so, only one tile is left closed in the hand.  The yakuman [[suukantsu]] always ends up as hadaka tanki at tenpai.

Of all the hand possibilities, hadaka tanki is the weakest position in terms of [[defense|defending]].  Only one tile can be exchanged by the draw-discard process.  This is due to the static nature of tiles in open calls.  The worst case scenario for a hand in hadaka tanki involves both the waiting tile and the drawn tile as winning tiles for another player.  In this case, a player has no choice but to play into another player's hand.

===Jigoku===
{{main|Jigoku}}
'''Jigoku''' {{kana|地獄}} is a specific tanki wait, where two tiles are rendered unavailable within the discards and/or the dora indicator.

===Nakabukure===
{{#mjt:000z3445s000000z}}

'''Nakabukure''' {{kana|中膨れ}} is a type of pair wait.  Here, the middle tile is duplicated in a [[shuntsu|sequence]].  So, the waiting tile is that single duplicated tile.  With two of the tiles of that type in hand, this gives the wait one less tile to wait for compared to a regular tanki.  An alternate term, '''harabote''' {{kana|腹ボテ}}, may be used, but it is also an inappropriate term.

== Chiitoitsu ==
{{main|Chiitoitsu}}

Every chiitoitsu tenpai hand uses tanki, as the pattern looks to match up the last pair for completion.

==Usage==
[[Image:Deceptive.png|thumb|right|250px|Tile discarded [http://tenhou.net/0/?log=2015010702gm-0089-0000-9548571b&tw=1&ts=4 appearing to be safe], when two already discarded.]]
Tanki, or single tile, is best used when seeking to win off of a player's discard.  While the number of waiting tiles is limited to a maximum of three, the pattern has its uses.  It's greatest strength stems from its ability to select any tile as a waiting tile, barring any tile limitations applied by certain yaku.  Often enough, this pattern may confuse players; and even traps, like [[suji]] traps, may be employed.  Not even [[kabe]] may be applicable.  Waits involving honor tiles, especially when one is discarded, is actually powerful, because players may believe those tiles are actually [[defense|safe tiles]].  All-in-all, this pattern is best used to counter or bait players, who are looking to defend.
