'''Ukeire''' {{kana|受け入れ}} factors the number of tiles needed to improve the hand and ultimately to tenpai.  Normally, this is under consideration with hand shapes of [[Shanten|2-shanten]] or less.  Hand shapes of 3-shanten or more produces very large ukeire counts, making it unnecessary to even be aware of the count during the game.
