'''Chuuren poutou''' {{kana|九連宝燈}} is a [[List of yaku#Yakuman|yakuman]] and a specific instance of [[chinitsu]]. It contains the 13-tile pattern 1-1-1-2-3-4-5-6-7-8-9-9-9 of the same suit,  plus any one more tile from the suit.  A special pattern of chuuren poutou [[Tenpai|tenpai]] produces one with a unique 9-sided wait.  In this case, the winning hand is then called '''junsei chuuren poutou''' {{kana|純正九蓮宝燈}}, or pure chuuren poutou.  The 13-tile pattern generates a 9-sided wait even as a normal hand with four sets and a pair. Chuuren poutou is therefore no hand shape exception, unlike [[Chiitoitsu|chiitoitsu]] and [[Kokushi musou|kokushi musou]].

==Tile pattern==

===Regular===
{{machi
|pattern   = 1112345578999p
|tilewaits = 6p
|yasume    = 59p
}}

If this hand wins with either of the yasume tiles, the hand will score only [[Chinitsu|chinitsu]] rather than the yakuman.

===Nine tile wait===
{{machi
|pattern   = 1112345678999p
|tilewaits = 123456789p
}}

==Value==

Chuuren is a yakuman hand.  However, while tenpai, some tile waits may actually award the hand for a considerably less value of haneman, as a closed chinitsu.  Some rules award a [[double yakuman]] instead when the hand goes out from the 9-sided wait.

==Development==
{{main|List of chuuren configurations}}
The key to this yakuman is the possession of ankou of both 1's and 9's of one suit.  Since this hand uses a single suit, it overlaps [[chinitsu]] during development.   In fact, many tenpai formations may result in chinitsu, rather than the yakuman.  This is due to the ability of chinitsu to form some [[Machi|complicated waits]].  If two of either group of tiles are not available, then any attempt at this yakuman is no longer possible.  Of course, that is in addition to the collection of a string consisting of 2-8 tiles of the same suit.  Likewise, if all four copies of any one of these numbered tiles are rendered unavailable, then the yakuman is no longer possible.
