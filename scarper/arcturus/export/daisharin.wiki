'''Daisharin''' {{kana|大車輪}} is one of three yakuman awarded for a closed hand with the following pattern: '''22334455667788'''.  The name daisharin applies to the [[pinzu]].  Using the exact same number pattern, '''daichikurin''' {{kana|大竹林}} and '''daisuurin''' {{kana|大数隣}} apply to [[souzu]] and [[manzu]] respectively.  Despite the difficulty of attaining this pattern, they are classed as [[Optional yaku|optional]].

Despite the fact that they are technically three different yaku, they are often referred to collectively as daisharin: a ruleset which uses daisharin usually implicitly also uses the other two, and occasionally a daichikurin or daisuurin hand will be incorrectly referred to as daisharin.

== Pattern ==

The pattern for daisharin differs only in which tile is used to win the hand, and will always have at least one [[yasume]] tile:

:{{#mjt:2233445667788p}} Agari: {{#mjt:5p}} Yasume: {{#mjt:28p}}

The same applies to daichikurin:

:{{#mjt:2334455667788s}} Agari: {{#mjt:2s}} Yasume: {{#mjt:58s}}

and daisuurin:

:{{#mjt:2233445567788m}} Agari: {{#mjt:6m}} Yasume: {{#mjt:9m}}

== Scoring ==

When classified as distinct yaku, daisharin and company are awarded yakuman. Even if they are not used, however, than hands are worth at least a sanbaiman:

* [[Pinfu]]: 1 han
* [[Tanyao]]: 1 han
* [[Ryanpeikou]]: 3 han
* [[Chinitsu]]: 6 han

The high score that this hand naturally achieves helps to explain why it is uncommonly scored as yakuman.
