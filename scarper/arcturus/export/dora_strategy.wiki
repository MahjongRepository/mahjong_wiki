The added [[han]] value to [[dora]] tiles warrants extra attention.  Ideally, players are encouraged to incorporate them into their hands to supplement their value.  However, many cases may render that as inconvenient or impossible.

In addition to dora, numbered tiles around dora are to be considered.  Players may possess [[machi|waiting patterns]] intended to win on dora tiles or have patterns with incorporated dora.  If dora happened to be [[honor tiles]], then [[yakuhai]] hands on that dora are amplified.

Under all cases, dora must not be carelessly discarded.  Players have two main options: discard them as soon as possible to get them out of the way, or possess them.  Additional decision making on dora rests on point standing.
