'''Renhou''' {{kana|人和}} is an [[optional yaku]].  It is defined by a player declaring [[ron]] with a starting hand before the dealer gets a second turn or before any [[Naki| called tile]].  This premise is similar to the [[chiihou]], except the hand wins by discard (ron).  In some instances, it may be considered as a [[yakuman]], [[mangan]], or not used at all.  Only non-dealers may invoke renhou, as the first discard always comes from the dealer (except when the dealer wins by [[tenhou]]).

Because of number of variations and interpretations to renhou, it is viewed as [[Yaku_variations#Renhou|optional]].

* '''[[Mangan]]'''
: By default, renhou can be defaulted as a mangan hand. In this case, if the hand could score more using normal counting of yaku and dora, it will be scored for the alternate value (since the highest-scoring hand must always be chosen). The hand must have at least one yaku for this, however; dora alone cannot allow the hand to be scored separately.
* '''[[Yakuman]]'''
: Likewise, it can be set as a yakuman.
* '''[[Baiman]]'''
: A few rulesets set renhou as a baiman, though this is relatively rare.
* '''[[Yaku]]'''
: Renhou may be considered as a yaku, to be [[yaku compatibility|cumulative with other yaku]], with a variable han value. It is frequently set at 4 han, so that the hand is always worth mangan minimum if it has any other yaku.
* '''Nashi'''
: Renhou may not be used at all.
