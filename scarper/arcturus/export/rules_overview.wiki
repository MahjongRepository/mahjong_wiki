Japanese mahjong is quite complex with its many rules and special cases. This article is a brief and quick layout to the most basic rules of the game, just to get new players started.  For more detailed documentation on the rules, see [[Japanese mahjong]], as well as other articles covering various game topics.

== Tiles and suits ==
{{main|Mahjong equipment}}

* Mahjong is played by four players 
* These tiles work similar to playing cards
* All in all, there are 34 tile types
* There are 4 copies each
* In total, there are 136 tiles
* The following are the three main suits, plus a class of "honor" tiles:

{|
|{{ #mjt:123456789m }}
|36 tiles in the '''[[manzu|man]]''' suit
|-
|{{ #mjt:123456789p }}
|36 tiles in the '''[[pinzu|pin]]''' suit
|-
|{{ #mjt:123456789s }}
|36 tiles in the '''[[souzu|sou]]''' suit
|-
|{{ #mjt:1234567z }}
|28 [[Jihai|honor tiles]]
|}

== Setup ==
[[image:setup.jpg|thumb|right|350px|Mahjong tiles at the initial setup before tiles are dealt.]]

* After tiles are shuffled, the players build walls of face-down tiles
* Each wall is 17 tiles long, double stacked
* The four walls serve as a stockpile to draw tiles from
* Each player starts with 25000 points
* Point sticks are used to keep score, when playing with real tiles

=== Starting the deal ===
* At the start of each hand after the walls are built, players are dealt 13 tiles each
* One player throughout the game is designated as the dealer, marked by an indicator
* The dealer is begins by rolling the dice, to determine the wall break

=== Seating positions ===
{{main|Jikaze}}

* The dealer is always seated East
* Player to the right of the dealer is South
* Player across the dealer is West
* Player to left of the dealer is North
* Regular turn order: East, South, West, North
* Per the turn order, each player gets 4 tiles per turn, until each has 12 tiles
* Finish the deal process by drawing one tile each, for 13 tiles in the hand
* '''Dealer always gets first draw and discard'''

== Objective ==
* Players take turns to draw and discard tiles to build complete hands (if possible)
* Develop [[Tenpai|ready hands]] and hopefully complete them by draw or discard
* [[Defense|Avoid playing into other player's hands]], or else lose points

* '''Ron''': Players who win by tile discard scores points off the discarder
* '''Tsumo''': Players who win by tile draw scores points off of the other three players

== Hands and yaku ==
* Winning hands of 14 tiles contain four [[Mentsu|melds]], plus a pair
:* Melds are specific groups of 3 tiles: 
:* The pair consists of any two identical tiles
:* Melds and pairs cannot be of mixed suits
* Two exceptions to this pattern: [[kokushi musou]] and [[Chii toitsu]]

A complete hand example:
* {{#mjt:234m}} {{#mjt:555s}} {{#mjt:345p}} {{#mjt:111z}} {{#mjt:77z}}

===Yaku===
{{main|List of yaku}} <!--link used at least three times here for emphasis-->
* A winning hand must have at least one [[List of yaku|yaku]] (see [[List of yaku|the list]] for pattern examples)
* A yaku is a special condition under which the win occurs, or a distinguished pattern within the hand's tiles
* These patterns may be viewed like poker hands
* Hands may have a combination of different yaku
* Hand value is primarily based on your yaku patterns
* Not all yaku are pattern-based, and it is not required to have a pattern-based yaku to win (e.g., you may win with riichi alone)

== Strategy ==
* A wide variety of strategies are employed, regarding building winning hands and avoiding other player's hands
* Memorization of the [[List of yaku|yaku]] is key
* Yet, players may continue to play the game simply building hands, without or with limited knowledge of the yaku
