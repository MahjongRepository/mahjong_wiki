'''Ryantan''' {{kana|リャンタン}} and '''pentan''' {{kana|ペンタン}} are [[Machi#Named_combinations|combination waits]], which involve a triplet and an adjacently appended numbered tile.  The tile combinations for both appear identical.  However, pentan involves [[terminals]], where as ryantan does not. 

Pentan is a combination of [[penchan]] and tanki.  This can occur in two ways, but both involve terminals and tiles 2 or 8.  When the triplet is composed of terminals, then the appended tile is either 2 or 8.  When the triplet is composed of either 2 or 8 tiles, then the appended tile is either 1 or 9.

Ryantan is a combination of [[ryanmen]] and [[tanki]].  The tile composition is a converse to pentan.  It involves triplets and appended tile of the other numbers: 2 through 8.  The terminals are excluded for this combination.
