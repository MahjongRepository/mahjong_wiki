'''Sanmentan''' is an extension to [[nobetan]], which utilizes multiple [[tanki]] (pair waits).  While nobetan uses two, sanmentan uses three.  Sanmentan is recognizable as a pattern of seven consecutive tiles.  Always, the [[machi|wait pattern]] utilizes a whole [[suji]] triple, like 2-5-8.

== Tile pattern ==

* {{#mjt:2345678p000000z}} Agari: {{#mjt:2p}}, {{#mjt:5p}}, or {{#mjt:8p}}

== Fu ==
{{main|Fu}}

Since the pattern seeks to complete the [[jantou|pair]], this pattern is awarded 2 fu.  It counts for the [[tanki|pair wait]], despite multiple instances of it.

==Development==
This waiting pattern is always a string of 7 numbered tiles.  Within this string of 7 tiles, two sequential tile groups can be formed, which may be shifted depending on the [[jantou|paired tile]].  To determine the tile wait with this pattern, especially when a [[complex machi|hybrid complex pattern]] is involved, the player needs to identify which tile will be the paired tile in the hand.
